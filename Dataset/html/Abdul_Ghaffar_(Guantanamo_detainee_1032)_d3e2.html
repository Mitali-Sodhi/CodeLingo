<p>Initially the Bush administration asserted that they could withhold all the protections of the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Geneva_Conventions_eb47.html" title="Geneva Conventions">Geneva Conventions</a> to captives from <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_war_on_terror.html" title="The war on terror">the war on terror</a>. This policy was challenged before the Judicial branch. Critics argued that the USA could not evade its obligation to conduct a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Competent_tribunal.html" title="Competent tribunal">competent tribunals</a> to determine whether captives are, or are not, entitled to the protections of <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prisoner_of_war.html" title="Prisoner of war">prisoner of war</a> status.</p>
<p>Subsequently the <a href="../../../d/e/p/Department_of_Defense_0d6c.html" title="Department of Defense">Department of Defense</a> instituted the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Combatant_Status_Review_Tribunal_41dd.html" title="Combatant Status Review Tribunal">Combatant Status Review Tribunals</a>. The Tribunals, however, were not authorized to determine whether the captives were <i>lawful combatants</i> -- rather they were merely empowered to make a recommendation as to whether the captive had previously been correctly determined to match the Bush administration's definition of an <a href="../../../e/n/e/Enemy_combatant.html" title="Enemy combatant">enemy combatant</a>.</p>

<p>Ghaffar denied any knowledge of the attack on the Red Cross. Denied ever carrying weapons. Asserted everyone in his neighbourhood would concur that he worked with a shovel, not a gun. He said he was too poor to own a gun.</p>
<p>Ghaffar said he welcomed the American overthrow of the Taliban, and had heard that the Red Cross were generous people who came to Afghanistan to do good works.</p>
<p>Ghaffar said he had a dispute, with a neighbor, who had threatened to denounce him to the Americans.</p>

<p>Detainees who were determined to have been properly classified as "enemy combatants" were scheduled to have their dossier reviewed at annual <a href="../../../a/d/m/Administrative_Review_Board_9651.html" title="Administrative Review Board">Administrative Review Board</a> hearings. The Administrative Review Boards weren't authorized to review whether a detainee qualified for POW status, and they weren't authorized to review whether a detainee should have been classified as an "enemy combatant".</p>
<p>They were authorized to consider whether a detainee should continue to be detained by the United States, because they continued to pose a threat -- or whether they could safely be repatriated to the custody of their home country, or whether they could be set free.</p>
