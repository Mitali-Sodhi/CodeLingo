<p>Abdullah ibn Saba was originally from the city of <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sana%60a.html" title="Sana`a">Sana`a</a> in <a href="../../../y/e/m/Yemen.html" title="Yemen">Yemen</a>. He was <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish.html" title="Jewish">Jewish</a> <a href="../../../r/a/b/Rabbi.html" title="Rabbi">Rabbi</a> who claimed a conversion to <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a> during the caliphate of `Uthman. He moved to <a href="../../../k/u/f/Kufa.html" title="Kufa">Kufa</a> and started adversely criticizing the Calif's administration. Thence he went to Egypt, where he founded an antiothmanian sect, to promote the interests of Ali. On account of his learning he obtained great influence there, and formulated the doctrine that, just as every prophet had an assistant who afterward succeeded him, <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a>'s vizier was Ali, who had therefore been kept out of the califate by deceit. He was able to promote a dissatisfaction with Uthman's government among his followers.</p>
<p>Tradition relates that when <a href="../../../a/l/i/Ali.html" title="Ali">Ali ibn Abi Talib</a> had assumed power, Ibn Saba became an adherent of the emerging <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shi%27ite.html" title="Shi'ite">Shi'ite</a> persuasion, and a strong supporter of Ali. He called for the divinity of `Ali. He initially did not openly preach these beliefs, but he later abandoned his secret and started a vigorous campaign.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> However, when Ibn Saba claimed that Ali is himself God by addressing him with the words, "Thou art Thou!", Ali declared him a heretic and burned some of his followers to the stake and expelled him to <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madain.html" title="Madain">Madain</a> (a city with Persian population).</p>
<p>After Ali's assassination Abdullah Ibn Saba is said to have taught that Ali was not dead but alive, and had never been killed; that a part of the Deity was hidden in him; and that after a certain time he would return to fill the earth with justice. Till then the divine character of Ali was to remain hidden in the <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shi%27a_Imams_77b5.html" title="Shi'a Imams">Imams</a>, who temporarily filled his place. It is easy to see that the whole idea rests on that of the Messiah in combination with the legend of <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elijah.html" title="Elijah">Elijah</a> the prophet<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Accourding to Sunni historical references, Abdullah Ibn Saba enticed the Muslims to kill Uthman <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup>. He also made mischief in the armies of Ali and his opponents in the battle of Camel, forcing the battle to start, althogh both parties did not want it.</p>
<p>He is considered by <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunni.html" title="Sunni">Sunni</a> writers as the originator of <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shi%27ah_Islam_9e29.html" title="Shi'ah Islam">Shi'ism</a> itself<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup>, although on account of his extremism this is considered by Shi`ites as an insult.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> The <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apostle_Paul_097e.html" title="Apostle Paul">Apostle Paul</a> and ‘Abdallah ibn Saba' were in classical times said to have been "Jewish agents" who infiltrated Christianity and Islam to destroy them from within.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Hafiz <a href="../../../i/b/n/Ibn_Hajar_1a76.html" title="Ibn Hajar">Ibn Hajar</a> threw more light on the dialogue between `Ali and ibn Saba on this occasion: "Abul Ijlas says that I heard `Ali telling `Abdullah ibn Saba: "By Allah, I have not hidden any secret from anyone which the Holy Prophet told me. I heard the Holy Prophet saying that there would appear thirty liars before the last day, and you are one of them." Once Suwaid ibn Ghafalah visited `Ali during his reign and told him that he had passed a few people amongst whom was ibn Saba speaking ill of Abu Bakr. They claimed that you also held the same opinion." `Ali retorted: "I have nothing to do with this black filthy creature. I seek refuge from Allah that I hold any opinion other than the best for Abu Bakr and `Umar." He then exiled ibn Saba saying that he could not tolerate to live with him in one city. `Ali then ascended the pulpit, and after relating the story said: "I will lash anyone who prefers me over Abu Bakr and `Umar, the lashing of a slanderer." <sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/d/Abdullah_Ibn_Saba_f960.html" title="Edit section: Old Shia View">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Old Shia View</span></h2>
<p>The well known Imami Shia critic, Nubakhti, wrote: "Abdullah bin Saba', was one of those who slandered Abu Bakr, Omar, Othman and the Companions and disowned them. He claimed that it was Ali who enjoined this on him. Ali arrested him, and upon interrogation, admitted to the charge, and (Ali) ordered him to be executed. The People cried 'O Chief of Believers! Do you execute a man calling to your love, Ahlul-Bayt, to your allegiance, and disowning your enemies?' He (Ali) then exiled him to al-Mada'in. Some of the knowledgeable companions of Ali narrated that Abdullah bin Saba' was a Jew who embraced Islam and sided with Ali. That he was of the opinion, at the time when he was a Jew, claiming that Yousha' bin Noon is after Moses. After his submission to Islam, after the demise of the Prophet, he claimed the same for Ali. He was the first to publicly mandate the Imamah of Ali, disowning his enemies, and debated his opposers. From thence, those who oppose Shia say: The origin of Shia is rooted in Judaism. When Abdullah bin Saba' heard of the demise of Ali while in (his exile at) al-Mada'in, he said to the announcer of the news: 'You are a liar, if you are to bring his head in seventy bags, and brought seventy witnesses testifying to his death, we'll insist that he did not die nor murdered, and (he) shall not die till he rules the globe.'"<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>Kash-shi, one of the earliest Shi'ite biographist, says: "Some people of knowledge mentioned that Abdullah bin Saba' was a Jew, who embraced Islam and supported Ali. While he was still a Jew, he used to go to extremism in calling Yousha' bin Noon as the appointee (successor) of Moses, thus after embracing Islam - after the demise of the Messenger of Allah (PBUH&amp;HF) - he said the like about Ali. It was him who first publicly announced the mandatory Imamah for Ali, rejected and disowned his enemies, debated his opponents and called them Kafirs. Hence, those who oppose the Shia often say: The Shi`a and Rejectors (Rafidah) have their roots in Judaism"<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>Majlisi said: "Some scholars have asserted that ibn Saba was a Jew who accepted Islam and started voicing his opinion of the `wilayat' (divine appointment) of `Ali. While a Jew, he propounded the exaggerative notion that Yusha ibn Nun was divinely appointed to succeed Prophet Musa, he thus adopted a similar stance with regard to `Ali in relation to the Holy Prophet. He was the first to subscribe to the belief of Imamate, and he openly vitriolated his enemies (i.e. the first three Caliphs) and branded them as infidels. The origin of Shi'ism is thus based on Judaism." <sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>Hasan bin Ali al-Hilli, a famous biographer, wrote: "Abdullah ibn Saba returned to disbelief and showed extremism. He claimed prophethood, and that Ali was Allah (in the flesh). Ali, for three (consecutive) days asked him to repent but he failed, thereupon, he burned him (alive) with seventy other men who attributed divinity to him."<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>Al-Astra Abadi, another biogropher, wrote: "Abdullah ibn Saba claimed prophethood and that Ali is himself Allah the Most Exalted. Upon hearing this charge, Ali called and inquired it from him. When he admitted, he said to him: back off from this saying and repent, may your mother lose you. However, (Abdullah Ibn Saba) refused, and (Ali) held him for three days, and, still refusing to repent, he therefore burned him (alive)."<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>

<p>Narrated to me Muhammad bin Qolawaih: Narrated to me Sa'd bin Abdullah, said: Narrated to us Yaqoub bin Yazeed and Muhammad bin Issa from Ali bin Mahziyar, from Fadalah bin Ayoub al-Azdi, from Abban bin Othman said: I heard Abu Abdullah (Ja'far as-Sadiq) saying: "May Allah curse Abdallah bin Saba', he claimed a divineship for Amirul-Mu'mineen (Ali). By Allah, Amierul-Mu'mineen was volunterily the slave of Allah. Woe to him who lie about us, for there are people who say about us what we don't say about ourselves,we clear ourselves to Allah from them, we clear ourselves to Allah from them."</p>
<p>Narrated Yaqoub bin Yazeed from Ibn Abi Omair and Ahmad bin Muhammad bin Issa, from his father and al-Husain bin Sa'eed, from Hisham bin Salim, from Abu Hamza al-Thumali said: Imam Ali bin al-Husain (Zaynul-Abideen) said: "May the curse of Allah be upon those who tell lies about us. I mentioned Abdullah Ibn Saba and each hair in my body stood up, Allah cursed him. Ali (AS) was, by Allah, a proper servant of Allah, the brother of the Messenger of Allah. He did not earn the graciousness/honor from Allah except with the obedience to Allah and His Messenger. And (similarly) the Messenger of Allah did not earn the honor from Allah except with his obedience to Allah."</p>
<p>Narrated Muhammad bin Khalid At-Tayalisi, from Ibn Abi Najran, from Abdullah bin Sinaan said: Abu Abdullah (Ja'far as-Sadiq) said: "We are a family of truthfulness. But we are not safe from a liar telling lies about us to undermine our truth with his lies in front of people. The Messenger of Allah was the most truthful among people in what he said (Lahjatan) and the most truthful among all humanity; and Musaylima used to lie on him. The Commander of Believers was the most truthful one among the creation of Allah after the Messenger of Allah; and the one who used to lie on him, and tried to undermine his truthfulness and claimed lies about Allah, was Abdullah Ibn Saba." <sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
