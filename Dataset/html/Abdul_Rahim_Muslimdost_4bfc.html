<p>Initially the Bush administration asserted that they could withhold all the protections of the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Geneva_Conventions_eb47.html" title="Geneva Conventions">Geneva Conventions</a> to captives from <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_war_on_terror.html" title="The war on terror">the war on terror</a>. This policy was challenged before the Judicial branch. Critics argued that the USA could not evade its obligation to conduct a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Competent_tribunal.html" title="Competent tribunal">competent tribunals</a> to determine whether captives are, or are not, entitled to the protections of <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prisoner_of_war.html" title="Prisoner of war">prisoner of war</a> status.</p>
<p>Subsequently the <a href="../../../d/e/p/Department_of_Defense_0d6c.html" title="Department of Defense">Department of Defense</a> instituted the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Combatant_Status_Review_Tribunal_41dd.html" title="Combatant Status Review Tribunal">Combatant Status Review Tribunals</a>. The Tribunals, however, were not authorized to determine whether the captives were <i>lawful combatants</i> -- rather they were merely empowered to make a recommendation as to whether the captive had previously been correctly determined to match the Bush administration's definition of an <a href="../../../e/n/e/Enemy_combatant.html" title="Enemy combatant">enemy combatant</a>.</p>
<p>Muslimdost chose to participate in his Combatant Status Review Tribunal.<sup id="_ref-CsrtMuslimdost_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CsrtMuslimdost" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<li><i>The detainee voluntarily traveled to <a href="../../../a/f/g/Afghanistan.html" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> in August 2001.</i></li>
<li><i>The detainee was a member of Jamaat ud Dawa il al Quran al Sunnat (JDQ).</i></li>
<li><i>Jamyat-u-Dawa-al-Quarani (JDQ) conducted training with several types of weapons in the Abdullah Abu Masood camp.</i></li>
<li><i>The JDQ is a militant religious school which trains students in military camps as well as classrooms. The JDQ has a militant wing and an assassination wing.</i></li>

<p>In response to the first allegation Muslimdost said he was an Afghani, and didn’t see anything wrong with entering his own country.</p>
<p>In response to the second allegation, that he was a member of the JDQ, he acknowledged he had been a member - 16 years previously. He grew disenchanted with the organization, and left around the time the Communists were thrown out, when he realized that the JDQ did not have Afghanistan’s best interests at heart.</p>
<p>He agreed that the JDQ were conducting training, and had conducted assassinations, but since he had left the organization he didn’t feel those allegations had anything to do with him. He said that the JDQ had tried to assassinate him.</p>
<p>He denied any ties to Al Qaeda, and he denied ever visiting Herat.</p>
<p>He said that the allegations against him were manufactured by the Pakistani authorities in an attempt to silence his criticisms. Dost said he was offered a chance to ransom himself, rather than being handed over to Americans. He asserted that senior al Qaeda and Taliban leaders had bought their freedom.</p>

<p>In answer to questions during the Tribunal Muslimdost stated:</p>
<ul>
<li>He considered himself an Afghani; he was born in Afghanistan; but he had spent most of the thirty years prior to the overthrow of the Taliban living in Pakistan.</li>
<li>He had traveled to Afghanistan to build schools. He didn’t travel to Afghanistan at all when the communists were in power. Following their fall he traveled to Afghanistan once or twice a year.</li>
<li>He described himself as an opponent of the Taliban. He had to sneak in during their time in power, because they did not approve of the schools he worked to set up. He had also worked as a journalist, and had written against Pakistan’s policies in Afghanistan.</li>
<li>In answer to a question as to why he had joined JDQ, Muslimdost said there had been many groups fighting the Soviets. He thought the other groups were “doing wrong”. JDQ was a new organization, so he thought he would try them. Then he found that the JDQ was secretly backed by the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Inter-Services_Intelligence_9c5f.html" title="Inter-Services Intelligence">ISI</a>, the Pakistani <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intelligence_%28information_gathering%29.html" title="Intelligence (information gathering)">intelligence</a> service. So he quit, and started publishing exposes. He said that the JDQ had made three attempts to assassinate him. (He had described the Taliban as being creatures of the ISI as well.)</li>
<li>In answer to a question as to which side the JDQ fought for in Afghanistan Muslimdost claimed they were playing both sides. Earlier he had said that the ISI wanted to use the JDQ to spread instability in Afghanistan.</li>
<li>He said he had only a little information about the JDQ’s efforts against the United States, but that he had learned that they had tried to put three agents in American agencies.</li>
<li>He was with the JDQ for approximately five years before he became disillusioned and quit.</li>

<ul>
<li>Herat was a small Province. There was no Al Qaeda presence in Herat.</li>
<li>He would have known if Muslimdost had set up an office in Herat. But he hadn’t. And they never met in Afghanistan.</li>
<li>He said he didn’t believe that the JDQ were operating in Herat either.</li>
