<p>Initially the Bush administration asserted that they could withhold all the protections of the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Geneva_Conventions_eb47.html" title="Geneva Conventions">Geneva Conventions</a> to captives from <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_war_on_terror.html" title="The war on terror">the war on terror</a>. This policy was challenged before the Judicial branch. Critics argued that the USA could not evade its obligation to conduct a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Competent_tribunal.html" title="Competent tribunal">competent tribunals</a> to determine whether captives are, or are not, entitled to the protections of <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prisoner_of_war.html" title="Prisoner of war">prisoner of war</a> status.</p>
<p>Subsequently the <a href="../../../d/e/p/Department_of_Defense_0d6c.html" title="Department of Defense">Department of Defense</a> instituted the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Combatant_Status_Review_Tribunal_41dd.html" title="Combatant Status Review Tribunal">Combatant Status Review Tribunals</a>. The Tribunals, however, were not authorized to determine whether the captives were <i>lawful combatants</i> -- rather they were merely empowered to make a recommendation as to whether the captive had previously been correctly determined to match the Bush administration's definition of an <a href="../../../e/n/e/Enemy_combatant.html" title="Enemy combatant">enemy combatant</a>.</p>
<p>In September 2004 camp authorities convened a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Combatant_Status_Review_Tribunal_41dd.html" title="Combatant Status Review Tribunal">Combatant Status Review Tribunal</a> to determine whether Al Bedani had been correctly classified as an "enemy combatant".</p>
<p>Al Bedani's case is noteworthy because his dossier was one of the few released in 2005 and made available for public download. The <a href="../../../a/s/s/Associated_Press_9ff2.html" title="Associated Press">Associated Press</a> acquired copies of the proceedings of some of the detainees, and made them available to the public.</p>
<p>Al Bedani chose not to participate in his Tribunal.<sup id="_ref-CsrtAlBedani_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CsrtAlBedani" title="">[2]</a></sup> Declining to participate seems to have been the legal advice to all the Guantanamo detainees who have lawyers.</p>

<p>The allegations that Al Bedani would have faced during his Tribunal were:</p>

<p>Detainees who were determined to have been properly classified as "enemy combatants" were scheduled to have their dossier reviewed at annual <a href="../../../a/d/m/Administrative_Review_Board_9651.html" title="Administrative Review Board">Administrative Review Board</a> hearings. The Administrative Review Boards weren't authorized to review whether a detainee qualified for POW status, and they weren't authorized to review whether a detainee should have been classified as an "enemy combatant".</p>
<p>They were authorized to consider whether a detainee should continue to be detained by the United States, because they continued to pose a threat -- or whether they could safely be repatriated to the custody of their home country, or whether they could be set free.</p>
<p>The factors for and against continuing to detain Al Bedani were among the 121 that the Department of Defense released on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_3.html" title="March 3">March 3</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>.<sup id="_ref-FactorsAlBedani_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-FactorsAlBedani" title="">[3]</a></sup> The "factors" presented to Al Bedani's Board were largely a superset of the allegations contained within Al Bedani's Tribunal:</p>
