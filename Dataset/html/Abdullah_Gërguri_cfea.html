<p><b>Abdullah Gerguri</b> (<a href="../../../1/9/3/1931.html" title="1931">1931</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a>) was a Kosovo Albanian painter. Gërguri was born in the village <a href="../../../s/i/b/Sibofc.html" title="Sibofc">Sibofc</a> of Podujevë (<a href="../../../b/e/s/Besiana.html" title="Besiana">Besiana</a>), <a href="../../../k/o/s/Kosovo.html" title="Kosovo">Kosovo</a>, in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1931.html" title="1931">1931</a>.</p>
<p>The painter-conservator Gërguri while he was working at the <a href="../../../i/n/s/Institute.html" title="Institute">Institute</a> for <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protection.html" title="Protection">Protection</a> of Cultural Monuments in <a href="../../../p/r/i/Pri%C5%A1tina.html" title="Priština">Priština</a>, was engaged heavily in conservation of frescos, icons and monuments, and also in their restoration.</p>
<p>He finished the High School of Arts in <a href="../../../p/e/j/Pej%C3%AB.html" title="Pejë">Pejë</a> -(Alb. <i>SHLP</i>) in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1954.html" title="1954">1954</a> (Kosovo). He was a member of the first student cohort at this school. Commenting on this, his colleague, Veli Gërvalla, says: “I remember very well how at that time they used to separate and supervise gifted students in fine arts and they use to send us in Pejë, and one of them was Abdullah Gërguri, who had extraordinary talent in drawing and painting.”</p>
<p>He, without any doubt, was distinguished with a specific gift in painting. While he was a student he created a specific style in comparison with the other students. After he finished this school, he was engaged as an art teacher in Podujevë’s high school. After he finished his course at the SHLP, the fine art group, he was engaged in Shkolla Normale in <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prishtin%C3%AB.html" title="Prishtinë">Prishtinë</a> during <a href="../../../1/9/5/1958.html" title="1958">1958</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/6/1961.html" title="1961">1961</a>. After this time he started to work at the <a href="../../../i/n/s/Institute.html" title="Institute">Institute</a> for <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protection.html" title="Protection">Protection</a> of Cultural Monuments in Prishtinë, where he worked until he died.</p>
<p>He firstly was engaged in Sinan Pasha’s Mosque in <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prizren.html" title="Prizren">Prizren</a>, which has a tall <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minaret.html" title="Minaret">minaret</a> with a large <a href="../../../d/o/m/Dome.html" title="Dome">dome</a> (diameter 14 meters, internal height 20 meters), where the mural paintings give magnificent and specific sight in this monumental and cultural building. The most important murals are in the middle of the dome, as is the main rosette. All mural paintings in Sinan Pasha Mosque are characterized with virtuous, spiritual drawings and a wealth of rare colours. The collection of the paintings within this mosque are considered among most beautiful examples of mural paintings of <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic.html" title="Islamic">Islamic</a> art in Kosovo. This <a href="../../../m/o/s/Mosque.html" title="Mosque">mosque</a> was built in <a href="../../../1/6/1/1615.html" title="1615">1615</a>. Its architect was Sofi-Sinan Pasha, born in village Vajle, Lumë-<a href="../../../a/l/b/Albania.html" title="Albania">Albania</a>.</p>
<p>In accordance with the decision of the <a href="../../../i/n/s/Institution.html" title="Institution">Institution</a> for <a href="../../../u/r/b/Urbanism.html" title="Urbanism">Urbanism</a> and <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protection.html" title="Protection">Protection</a> of the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monuments.html" title="Monuments">Monuments</a> of the <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture.html" title="Culture">Culture</a> in <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prizren.html" title="Prizren">Prizren</a>, on <a href="../../../2/1/s/21st_September_e28d.html" title="21st September">21st September</a> <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972.html" title="1972">1972</a>, Abdullah Gërguri started work on the conservation and restoration of mural paintings in the mosque. At that time, the mosque had significant damage which he later repaired. Two types of repairs were necessary: revealing old paintings and conservation of two layers of the paintings. The conservation of the paintings on the dome was done later. The surfaces of the dome were repaired during four seasons: in years <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972.html" title="1972">1972</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/7/1974.html" title="1974">1974</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a>.</p>
<p>Gërguri has also worked in the Hadum Mosque in <a href="../../../g/j/a/Gjakova.html" title="Gjakova">Gjakova</a>. In this mosque Gërguri shows an individual and specific skill. He also shows flourishing and very qualitative work in the Great Mosque (<a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a>) in Prishtinë.</p>
<p>He later worked on restoration of the arabesques and decorative mural paintings of the othet historical monuments. Gerguri has worked on the <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patriarchate_of_Pe%C4%87_754a.html" title="Patriarchate of Peć">Patriarchate of Peć</a> – Saint Apostles in <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gracanica.html" title="Gracanica">Gracanica</a>, in Saint Prentia also. While he was working at the Institute for Protection of Cultural Monuments in Prishtina, on conservation of frescoes, icons, and other monuments, he also worked in Saint John’s Church in Hoca, Saint Peter of Korishtë in Kabash and Saint Nicola’s Church on Sicevë which were built in <a href="../../../1/4/t/14th_century.html" title="14th century">14th century</a>.</p>
<p>Gërguri worked also out of Kosovo. He worked in <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Macedonia_2bfd.html" title="Republic of Macedonia">Macedonia</a> (Ohër-<a href="../../../o/h/r/Ohrid.html" title="Ohrid">Ohrid</a>), in different churches on fresco restoration. He was largely engaged also in many churches in <a href="../../../b/o/s/Bosnia_and_Herzegovina_c758.html" title="Bosnia and Herzegovina">Bosnia</a>. In these churches, too, he showed great talent and specific individuality of the painter and true expertise. He showed that he is painter with great sensibility and as always he was deeply and truly engaged in it. His talent and engagement came as a result of his proper knowledge, and of course because of this he was given awards many times.</p>
<p>During the 30th anniversary of the Protection of the Monuments of Culture, for his extraordinary work he was awarded the diploma and medallion. During the 10th anniversary of the creation of the Institute for the Protection]] of Cultural Monuments in Prizren, he was awarded with a certificate for outstanding work. He was on different specializations in <a href="../../../c/r/o/Croatia.html" title="Croatia">Croatia</a>, <a href="../../../s/l/o/Slovenia.html" title="Slovenia">Slovenia</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/s/Bosnia_and_Herzegovina_c758.html" title="Bosnia and Herzegovina">Bosnia</a> etc, and to gain more knowledge about the achievements on the conservation of the monuments, he visited <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albania.html" title="Albania">Albania</a>, <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkey.html" title="Turkey">Turkey</a>, and <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greece.html" title="Greece">Greece</a>…</p>
<p>He is known for his conservation and restoration of mural paintings. He was the only painter at that time in Kosovo working in this field.</p>
<p>Painter Gërguri also used to copy <a href="../../../o/r/t/Orthodox_Christian_8268.html" title="Orthodox Christian">Orthodox Christian</a> frescoes and icons in his spare time while he was working in different churches in Kosovo. Among these are: '<a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_John_4ff8.html" title="Saint John">Saint John</a>', 'The Girl with the Pot' (Pecka Patriarhija), 'Portrait of the <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apostle.html" title="Apostle">Apostle</a>”, '<a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> of <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prizren.html" title="Prizren">Prizren</a>', 'A detail from the Secret Supper' (Saint Prenia, <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prizren.html" title="Prizren">Prizren</a>), 'Saint Mercury', ' <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Mary_876e.html" title="Saint Mary">Saint Mary</a> on the <a href="../../../t/h/r/Throne.html" title="Throne">Throne</a>' (Hoçë e Madhe), '<a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Nicolas_b5ae.html" title="Saint Nicolas">Saint Nicolas</a>'(Kabash), 'Detail form the icon' (Deçan) etc. <a href="http://www.gerguri.net/Abdullah/" class="external text" title="http://www.gerguri.net/Abdullah/">Abdullah Gërguri</a>, is an important artist in restoration and conservation of the icons and frescoes.</p>
