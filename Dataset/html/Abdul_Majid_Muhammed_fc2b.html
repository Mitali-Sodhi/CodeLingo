<p>Initially the Bush administration asserted that they could withhold all the protections of the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Geneva_Conventions_eb47.html" title="Geneva Conventions">Geneva Conventions</a> to captives from <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_war_on_terror.html" title="The war on terror">the war on terror</a>. This policy was challenged before the Judicial branch. Critics argued that the USA could not evade its obligation to conduct a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Competent_tribunal.html" title="Competent tribunal">competent tribunals</a> to determine whether captives are, or are not, entitled to the protections of <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prisoner_of_war.html" title="Prisoner of war">prisoner of war</a> status.</p>
<p>Subsequently the Department of Defense instituted the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Combatant_Status_Review_Tribunal_41dd.html" title="Combatant Status Review Tribunal">Combatant Status Review Tribunals</a>. The Tribunals, however, were not authorized to determine whether the captives were <i>lawful combatants</i> -- rather they were merely empowered to make a recommendation as to whether the captive had previously been correctly determined to match the Bush administration's definition of an <a href="../../../e/n/e/Enemy_combatant.html" title="Enemy combatant">enemy combatant</a>.</p>

<li>In response to the allegation that he entered Afghanistan, from Iran, after September 11th:
<ul>
<li>Huhammed identified himself as a <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic.html" title="Catholic">Catholic</a>. <i>(When asked to swear in, prior to his testimony, he used the non-Muslim oath.)</i></li>
<li>Muhammed said the sole reason he crossed into Afghanistan was to try to make money smuggling drugs. This trip was the first trip to Afghanistan to smuggle drugs.</li>
<li>Muhammed said he had no animosity against the USA.</li>
<li>Huhammed said he was wanted by the Iranian military because he was a deserter.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In response to the allegations that he was a Taliban watchman:
<ul>
<li>Muhammed denied any involvement with the Taliban.</li>
<li>Muhammed said the Taliban do not like Iranians because they are not <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunni.html" title="Sunni">Sunni</a> Muslims.</li>
<li>Muhammed said he believed the Taliban would have killed him if they learned he was Catholic.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>See above.</li>
<li>In response to the allegations that he was captured by the Northern Alliiance near Ghazni.
<ul>
<li>Muhammad acknowledged being captured by the Northern Alliance. He couldn't state where.</li>
<li>Muhammad described his capture in detail. He was washing himself by the side of the road when several trucks full of armed Afghans drove up and took him prisoner. They spoke to him in <a href="../../../p/a/s/Pashtun.html" title="Pashtun">Pashtun</a> -- which he doesn't speak. But he could tell they were very excited. And he understood when they kept shouting "Arab! Arab! Arab!".</li>
<li>Muhammad said that when he was taken back to their base there were some people who spoke some Persian who tried to tell the others he was an Iranian. They pointed out that his complexion was dark, like an Iranians. But the others didn't care, because the USA paid a bounty for Arabs, not Iranians.</li>
<li>The Afghans didn't feed him, or give him any water, during the two days it took them to take him to the Americans.</li>

<p>Muhammed said he worked as a well digger. But he didn't like doing that because it was dangerous, and didn't pay well. He also said he had worked for a drug dealer.</p>
<p>Muhammad said he became involved in the drug trade after being released from a psychiatric hospital:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"When I got out of the hospital I found a friend and he told me that he was working in narcotics trading and stuff like that. He told me that he would work with me, since it was the first time that I found a friend, at the age of eighteen. Muhammad acknowledged he had been working for the drug dealer for seven to eight years as a street level drug dealer, selling <a href="../../../o/p/i/Opium.html" title="Opium">Opium</a> and <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hashish.html" title="Hashish">Hashish</a>.</i></dd>

</dl>
<p>Muhammed acknowledged that he was a little bit of an addict himself, and he was in debt. He acknowledged that he had been arrested, and imprisoned, twice, for selling drugs in Iran.</p>
<p>Muhammed said the trip where he was captured was his first trip to Afghanistan. He knew some Afghans in Iran, who had made it sound easy. But he had been in Afghanistan for fifteen days, without making any contacts.</p>
<p>Muhammed said he knew that there was a war in Afghanistan, but he had heard that all the fighting had stopped. That is why he thought it would be safe for him to travel. Muhammed said he traveled after Ramadan. <i>(ie. December 2001)</i></p>
<p>Muhammed said an Afghan friend had obtained a photo ID card, valid to the <a href="../../../h/e/z/Hezb-e-Islami_Gulbuddin_8282.html" title="Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin">Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin</a> militia, which he gave to him, so he could cross the Iran-Afghanistan border. His friend had taken his picture, and 5,000 in Iranian money to bribe the clerk, to the local HiG office in Iran, and told the clerk Muhammed was his brother.</p>

<p>Detainees who were determined to have been properly classified as "enemy combatants" were scheduled to have their dossier reviewed at annual <a href="../../../a/d/m/Administrative_Review_Board_9651.html" title="Administrative Review Board">Administrative Review Board</a> hearings. The Administrative Review Boards weren't authorized to review whether a detainee qualified for POW status, and they weren't authorized to review whether a detainee should have been classified as an "enemy combatant".</p>
<p>They were authorized to consider whether a detainee should continue to be detained by the United States, because they continued to pose a threat -- or whether they could safely be repatriated to the custody of their home country, or whether they could be set free.</p>

<p>Muhammed acknowledged that working in the drug trade was a bad thing. He pointed out that he had been well behaved while in Guantanamo. He said he is a peaceful person, who doesn't like fighting. He pointed out to the Board that he is a Catholic. He said he doesn't disrespect any religion.</p>
<p>Muhammed told his Board that he had tried to kill himself in Guantanamo. But now he was at peace. He has told the prisoners who want to kill him to go ahead and kill him, because he knows he will wake up and go beside God. He said he needs to be a friend to everybody, young or old, man or woman, all of them. He looks at everybody like a brother, sister, mother.</p>
<p>Muhammed pleaded for the Board's help in going home. He told the Board that two months previously he had received a letter from home, saying a drug dealer had killed his daughter. He said that he owed a large debt to this drug dealer, and that is why he went to Afghanistan, to smuggle drugs.</p>
