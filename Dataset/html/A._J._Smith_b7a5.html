<p>A.J. Smith currently resides as Executive Vice President and General Manager of the San Diego Chargers. He began his second tenure with the Chargers on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_22.html" title="April 22">April 22</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>, 11 days after close friend and longtime associate <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Butler_d856.html" title="John Butler">John Butler</a> passed away as a result of lung cancer. Chargers President Dean Spanos would give A.J. Smith control over the team as a result.</p>
<p>Smith was named Executive of the Year in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a> by <a href="../../../c/b/s/CBS_250c.html" title="CBS">CBS</a> Sportsline.com after the Chargers reciprocated the previous year's record of 4-12 and went 12-4 on the way to an <a href="../../../a/f/c/AFC_West_caa4.html" title="AFC West">AFC West</a> title. In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, the Chargers went 9-7 yet failed to make the playoffs and were criticized for their inability to win close games early in the season. However, first round pick Shawne Merriman was named <a href="../../../a/s/s/Associated_Press_9ff2.html" title="Associated Press">Associated Press</a> <a href="../../../n/f/l/NFL_Rookie_of_the_Year_Award_88bc.html" title="NFL Rookie of the Year Award">Defensive Rookie of the Year</a> and was considered as a successful acquisition by Smith.</p>

<p>A.J. Smith has been criticized by fans and <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mass_media.html" title="Mass media">media</a> for his hardball approach in the handling of uncooperative players as well as his high-risk/high-reward strategies.</p>

<p>In April, 2004 a week prior to the <a href="../../../n/f/l/NFL_Draft_4cd4.html" title="NFL Draft">NFL Draft</a> (in which the Chargers held the #1 Overall pick), <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Mississippi_d3d6.html" title="University of Mississippi">University of Mississippi</a> <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quarterback.html" title="Quarterback">quarterback</a> <a href="../../../e/l/i/Eli_Manning_3f21.html" title="Eli Manning">Eli Manning</a> declared he would not play for the Chargers if drafted by them. Smith elected to forego Manning's threats and select him #1 without straying from his objective. Moments later, Smith completed a trade with the New York Giants which sent Manning to New York in exchange for <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Carolina_State_University_da5b.html" title="North Carolina State University">North Carolina State University</a> quarterback <a href="../../../p/h/i/Phillip_Rivers_c4a5.html" title="Phillip Rivers">Phillip Rivers</a> (drafted 4th overall), as well as a 3rd-round pick in 2004, a 1st round pick in 2005, and a 5th round pick in 2005. Many were astounded that Smith was able to receive so much for Manning and the Giants were questioned for their trading away of a first round pick. A year later, the Chargers used the first round pick acquired from the giants to select Shawne Merriman 12th overall. Merriman went on to win the AP's <a href="../../../n/f/l/NFL_Defensive_Rookie_of_the_Year_Award_bad4.html" title="NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year Award">NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year Award</a>.</p>

Prior to the 2005 season, Gates held out of training camp, seeking a long-term <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contract.html" title="Contract">contract</a>. Smith would eventually give Gates an <a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultimatum.html" title="Ultimatum">ultimatum</a>; end the hold out by 12:30 PM on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_20.html" title="August 20">August 20</a>, or be placed on the Roster Exempt List. Gates failed to meet the deadline and as a result missed the team's first regular season game against the <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dallas_Cowboys_c876.html" title="Dallas Cowboys">Dallas Cowboys</a> which resulted in a 28-24 loss. Gates and Smith would eventually reach an accord and Gates was signed to a 6-year, $24 million contract.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/2E/_/A._J._Smith_b7a5.html" title="Edit section: Drew Brees">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Drew Brees</span></h3>
<p>Quarterback <a href="../../../d/r/e/Drew_Brees_80bb.html" title="Drew Brees">Drew Brees</a> suffered a torn <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labrum.html" title="Labrum">labrum</a> in the final game of the 2005 season against the <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denver_Broncos_cd7b.html" title="Denver Broncos">Denver Broncos</a> which immediately resulted in the reconsidering of signing Brees to a long-term contract. Many assumed the Chargers would offer Brees the <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franchise_Tag_69a7.html" title="Franchise Tag">franchise tag</a> for the second consecutive year. However, with second-year quarterback Philip Rivers on the team, Smith elected to offer Brees a heavily incentive-based contract which Brees rejected. Subsequently, Smith allowed Brees to become a free agent much to the dismay of Charger fans who had considered Brees a fan favorite due to his work ethic and comeback story. Brees would eventually sign a 6-year, 60 million dollar deal with the New Orleans Saints on March 14, 2006. Many claimed Smith had betrayed Brees due to the lack of sufficient guaranteed money offered in Brees' contract.</p>
