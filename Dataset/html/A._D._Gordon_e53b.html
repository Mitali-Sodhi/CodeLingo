<p><b>Aaron David Gordon</b> (<a href="../../../1/8/5/1856.html" title="1856">1856</a> in Troianov or <a href="../../../p/o/d/Podolia.html" title="Podolia">Podolia</a> <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russia</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/2/1922.html" title="1922">1922</a> on <a href="../../../k/i/b/Kibbutz.html" title="Kibbutz">Kibbutz</a> <a href="../../../d/e/g/Deganiah.html" title="Deganiah">Deganiah</a>) was a <a href="../../../z/i/o/Zionist.html" title="Zionist">Zionist</a> ideologue and the spiritual force behind practical Zionism. He founded the "Hapoel Hatzair" ("Young Worker") movement that set the tone for the Zionist movement for many years to come. Influenced by Tolstoy and others, it is said that in effect he made a religion of labor. However, he himself wrote in 1920, "Surely in our day it is possible to live without religion."</p>
<p>Gordon was the only child of a well-to-do family of <a href="../../../o/r/t/Orthodox_Judaism_0be8.html" title="Orthodox Judaism">Orthodox Jews</a>. He was self-educated in both religious and general studies, and spoke several languages. For thirty years, he managed an estate, where he proved to be a charismatic educator and community activist. Gordon married his cousin, Faige Tartakov, at a young age and had seven children with her, though only two of them survived.</p>
<p>Gordon was an early member of the Hibbat Tziyon (love of Zion) movement and emigrated to <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestine_%28region%29.html" title="Palestine (region)">Palestine</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/0/1904.html" title="1904">1904</a>, when he was already forty-eight years old. His wife and daughter immigrated with him, but his son refused to accompany him because of differences in their religious outlooks. Just four months after he arrived in the country, his wife took ill and died. Gordon lived in <a href="../../../p/e/t/Petah_Tikva_24fa.html" title="Petah Tikva">Petah Tikva</a> and <a href="../../../r/i/s/Rishon_LeZion_39d9.html" title="Rishon LeZion">Rishon LeZion</a>, before finally settling in the <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galilee.html" title="Galilee">Galilee</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1919.html" title="1919">1919</a>. He supported himself as a hired agricultural hand, living simply and writing his emerging philosophy at night. Out of principle, he refused to become involved in any of the Zionist political parties, though he participated in the Zionist Congress of <a href="../../../1/9/1/1911.html" title="1911">1911</a>.</p>
<p>Gordon believed that all of Jewish suffering could be traced to the parasitic state of Jews in the <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diaspora.html" title="Diaspora">Diaspora</a>, who were unable to participate in creative labor. To remedy this, he sought to promote physical labor and agriculture as a means of uplifting Jews spiritually. It was the experience of labor, he believed, that linked the individual to the hidden aspects of nature and being, which, in turn were the source of vision, <a href="../../../p/o/e/Poetry.html" title="Poetry">poetry</a>, and the spiritual life. Furthermore, he also believed that working the land was a sacred task, not only for the individual but for the entire Jewish people. Agriculture would unite the people with the land and justify its continued existence there. In his own words: "The Land of Israel is acquired through labor, not through fire and not through blood." Return to the soil would transform the Jewish people and allow its rejuventation, according to his philosphy.</p>
<p>He wrote:</p>
<p><i>The Jewish people has been completely cut off from nature and imprisoned within city walls for two thousand years. We have been accustomed to every form of life, except a life of labor- of labor done at our behalf and for its own sake. It will require the greatest effort of will for such a people to become normal again. We lack the principal ingredient for national life. We lack the habit of labor… for it is labor which binds a people to its soil and to its national culture, which in its turn is an outgrowth of the people's toil and the people's labor.</i> ... We, the Jews, were the first in history to say: "For all the nations shall go each in the name of its God" and "Nations shall not lift up sword against nation" - and then we proceed to cease being a nation ourselves.</p>
<p><i>As we now come to re-establish our path among the ways of living nations of the earth, we must make sure that we find the right path. We must create a new people, a human people whose attitude toward other peoples is informed with the sense of human brotherhood and whose attitude toward nature and all within it is inspired by noble urges of life-loving creativity. All the forces of our history, all the pain that has accumulated in our national soul, seem to impel us in that direction... we are engaged in a creative endeavor the like of which is itself not to be found in the whole history of mankind: the rebirth and rehabilitation of a people that has been uprooted and scattered to the winds...</i> (A.D. Gordon, "Our Tasks Ahead" 1920)</p>
<p>More than just a theoretician, he insisted on putting this philosophy into practice, and refused to take any clerical position that was offered to him. He was an elderly intellectual of no great physical strength and with no experience doing manual labor, but he took up the <a href="../../../h/o/e/Hoe.html" title="Hoe">hoe</a> and worked in the fields, always focusing on the aesthetics of his work. Unlike other Zionist leaders, he served as a model of the pioneering spirit, descending to the people and remaining with them no matter what the consequences were. He experienced the problems faced by the working class, suffering from <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malaria.html" title="Malaria">malaria</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/v/Poverty.html" title="Poverty">poverty</a>, and unemployment. In turn, this made him the spiritual leader of the working class, which turned to him for advice and help.</p>
<p>Gordon had always been a principled individual--even as a young man he refused to allow his parents to pay the customary <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bribe.html" title="Bribe">bribe</a> so that he would be exempted from military service, arguing that if he didn’t serve, someone else would have to serve instead of him. In the end, he spent six months in the army, but was released when it was discovered that he was not in good enough physical shape. He later refused to accept payment for his articles or the classes he taught, citing the <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mishnah.html" title="Mishnah">Mishnah</a> that states "Do not turn the <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torah.html" title="Torah">Torah</a> into a source of income." At the same time, he did not lapse into dogmatism either. When <a href="../../../r/a/c/Rachel_Bluwstein_e456.html" title="Rachel Bluwstein">Rachel the Poet</a> asked his opinion about whether she should go overseas to study, an idea that was anathema to most of the Zionist leadership, he encouraged her to do so.</p>
<p>Gordon remained an Orthodox Jew throughout most of his life. It was only in his later years that he began to abandon the commandments. Students of his writings have found that Gordon was greatly influenced by Russian author <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leo_Tolstoy_eb79.html" title="Leo Tolstoy">Leo Tolstoy</a>, as well as by the <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hasidic_Judaism_a5c0.html" title="Hasidic Judaism">Hassidic movement</a> and the <a href="../../../k/a/b/Kabbalah.html" title="Kabbalah">Kabbalah</a>. Many have also found parallels between his ideas and those of his contemporary, Rabbi <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham_Isaac_Kook_d5d7.html" title="Abraham Isaac Kook">Abraham Isaac Kook</a>, the spiritual father of modern religious Zionism.</p>
<p>Gordon's moods alternated between enormous frustration and great hope for the future. He believed that an idealistic new generation of creative Jews would emerge in the Land of Israel, with a high sense of morals, a deep spiritual commitment, and a commitment to their fellow human beings. Toward the end of his life, however, he preferred to isolate himself in <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nature.html" title="Nature">Nature</a>. From a letter he wrote to <a href="../../../r/a/c/Rachel_Bluwstein_e456.html" title="Rachel Bluwstein">Rachel the Poet</a>, it seems that he grew more and more frustrated with people's petty squabbles and selfish interests.</p>
<p>He founded and led the Hapoel Hatzair ("young worker") non-Marxist Zionist movement, as opposed to the <a href="../../../p/o/a/Poalei_Zion_e869.html" title="Poalei Zion">Poalei Zion</a> ("workers of Zion") movement which was more Marxian and associated with <a href="../../../b/e/r/Ber_Borochov_02da.html" title="Ber Borochov">Ber Borochov</a> and <a href="../../../n/a/h/Nahum_Syrkin_8cf0.html" title="Nahum Syrkin">Nahum Syrkin</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../g/o/r/Gordonia_youth_movement.html" title="Gordonia youth movement">Gordonia youth movement</a>, created to put Gordon's teachings into practice, established several kibbutzim in <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a>.</p>
<p>Gordon died of <a href="../../../t/h/r/Throat_cancer.html" title="Throat cancer">throat cancer</a> on Kibbutz <a href="../../../d/e/g/Deganiah.html" title="Deganiah">Deganiah</a> at the age of sixty-six.</p>
