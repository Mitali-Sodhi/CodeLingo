	    <p><b>Abdul Nacer Benbrika</b> (<a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic_language.html" title="Arabic language">Arabic</a>: عبد الناصر بن بريكة) (born about <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960.html" title="1960">1960</a>), <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australian</a> <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Muslim</a> activist, also known as <b>Abu Bakr</b> (Arabic: أبو بكر), was one of 17 men arrested in the Australian cities of <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney.html" title="Sydney">Sydney</a> and <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne.html" title="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> in November <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, and charged with membership of a <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism.html" title="Terrorism">terrorist</a> organisation and of planning terrorist attacks on targets within Australia. Benbrika is alleged to be the spiritual leader of the group. Lawyers for Benbrika and the other men arrested have denied all the charges.</p>
<p>Benbrika was born in <a href="../../../a/l/g/Algeria.html" title="Algeria">Algeria</a>: various sources give his age as 45 or 46 as of November 2005. He was trained as an aircraft engineer. He arrived in Australia in May <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a> on a one-month visitor's permit, on which he twice gained extensions, and settled in the northern suburbs of Melbourne, an area with a large Muslim population. After the expiry of his permit in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a> he became a prohibited non-citizen, then spent the next six years fighting through the Immigration Review Tribunal appeals process, for the right to stay. During his hearings he told the Tribunal of his "love of the Australian lifestyle".</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a> Benbrika married a Lebanese woman who was an Australian citizen and, with whom he had six children. He was granted Australian residence in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a> and became an Australian citizen in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a>, although he is reported to have retained his Algerian citizenship as well.</p>
<p>Benbrika is frequently referred to as an Islamic cleric, but it is unclear whether he has undertaken any formal Islamic theological training. For a time he attended and taught at the Melbourne religious centre run by Sheikh Mohamed Omran, a Muslim cleric who leads a group called the Ahlus Sunnah wal Jamaah Association. According to media reports, Benbrika was at one time the group's deputy leader, although Omran denies this. He later left Omran's group and formed his own, smaller group.</p>
<p>The Islamic Council of Victoria (ICV) says that Benbrika had no standing within the Muslim community. ICV board member <a href="../../../w/a/l/Waleed_Aly_c8da.html" title="Waleed Aly">Waleed Aly</a> said Benbrika's group was "a splinter of a splinter of a splinter. Most Muslims had never heard of him until he appeared on the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Broadcasting_Corporation_9631.html" title="Australian Broadcasting Corporation">ABC</a>." The majority of Muslims in Melbourne are of <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkey.html" title="Turkey">Turkish</a> or <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albania.html" title="Albania">Albanian</a> descent and have little sympathy with Islamic radicalism, which is usually associated with the <a href="../../../l/e/b/Lebanon.html" title="Lebanon">Lebanese</a> or other Arab Muslims in Sydney.</p>
<p>"You have got Mohamed Omran's group - he found that was not radical enough," Waleed Aly was quoted as saying. "So he formed his own group with a handful of young men who he calls his students. As far as I am concerned, he has no more sway over the Muslim community in Victoria than any cult leader would have over the religious communities from which they are splintered." Benbrika's students included a number of those arrested along with him in November, several of whom are alleged to have undergone paramilitary training in <a href="../../../a/f/g/Afghanistan.html" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> or <a href="../../../p/a/k/Pakistan.html" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>.</p>
<p>Benbrika came to public attention when he told an ABC Radio interviewer: "<a href="../../../o/s/a/Osama_bin_Laden_a745.html" title="Osama bin Laden">Osama bin Laden</a>, he is a great man. Osama bin Laden was a great man before 11 September, which they said he did it, until now nobody knows who did it." He was quoted as defending Muslims fighting against coalition forces in <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraq.html" title="Iraq">Iraq</a> and Afghanistan, and said anyone who fought in the name of God would be forgiven their sins. "According to my religion, <a href="../../../j/i/h/Jihad.html" title="Jihad">jihad</a> is a part of my religion and what you have to understand is that anyone who fights for the sake of Allah, when he dies, the first drop of blood that comes from him out all his sin will be forgiven."</p>
<p>During <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a> and <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> Australian security agencies had Benbrika under surveillance as a possible instigator of terrorist acts. In March his passport was confiscated on advice from the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Security_Intelligence_Organisation_7fc9.html" title="Australian Security Intelligence Organisation">Australian Security Intelligence Organisation</a> (ASIO), and ASIO agents raided his Melbourne home in June. In November, according to media reports, ASIO became convinced that Benbrika's group, and affiliated group in Sydney, was actively planning a terrorist attack. On the advice of ASIO, the Australian Parliament amended the law relating to terrorism, broadening the definition of planning a terrorist act. A few days later police raids in Sydney and Melbourne arrested Benbrika and 16 other men, one of whom was shot after allegedly opening fire on police in Sydney.</p>
<p>Benbrika and his fellow defendants (Shane Kent, Fadal Sayadi, Raad Ahmed, <a href="../../../a/m/e/Amer_Haddara_52f0.html" title="Amer Haddara">Amer Haddara</a>, Abdulla Merhi Raad Ezzit, Hany Taha and Aimen Joud) appeared in a Melbourne magistrate's court the day after their arrest. All are of Muslim immigrant backgrounds except Kent, who is a convert. Benbrika was charged with "directing the activities of a terrorist organization." He did not apply for bail and was remanded in custody until January <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, when he will stand trial.</p>
<p>Government and police officials said the group was stockpiling chemicals that could have been used to make explosives. According to the Melbourne <i><a href="../../../h/e/r/Herald_Sun_1ee3.html" title="Herald Sun">Herald Sun</a></i>, the group was "plotting a terrorist spectacular on the scale of the al-Qaeda attacks on London and Madrid." The Victorian Police Commissioner, <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christine_Nixon_d93e.html" title="Christine Nixon">Christine Nixon</a>, said she believed the arrests, which came after 16 months of police surveillance, had "seriously disrupted the activities of a group intent on carrying out a terrorist attack." The raids were planned after new information was obtained, she said. She said that although the group had no known specific target, "We were concerned that the attack was imminent, and we believe that we have sufficient evidence that will go before the courts to show that."</p>
<p>In an interview before his arrest, Benbrika denied that he was involved in terrorist activities. "I am not involved in anything here," he said. "I am teaching my brothers here the <a href="../../../k/o/r/Koran.html" title="Koran">Koran</a> and the <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunnah.html" title="Sunnah">Sunnah</a>, and I am trying my best to keep myself, my family, my kids and the Muslims close to their religion." But he also said it was a "big problem" for Muslims reconciling their religion with life in Australia. "There are two laws. There is Australian law. There is Islamic law," he said.</p>
