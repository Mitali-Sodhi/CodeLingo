<p>Initially the Bush administration asserted that they could withhold all the protections of the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Geneva_Conventions_eb47.html" title="Geneva Conventions">Geneva Conventions</a> to captives from <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_war_on_terror.html" title="The war on terror">the war on terror</a>. This policy was challenged before the Judicial branch. Critics argued that the USA could not evade its obligation to conduct <a href="../../../c/o/m/Competent_tribunal.html" title="Competent tribunal">competent tribunals</a> to determine whether captives are, or are not, entitled to the protections of <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prisoner_of_war.html" title="Prisoner of war">prisoner of war</a> status.</p>
<p>Subsequently the <a href="../../../d/e/p/Department_of_Defense_0d6c.html" title="Department of Defense">Department of Defense</a> instituted the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Combatant_Status_Review_Tribunal_41dd.html" title="Combatant Status Review Tribunal">Combatant Status Review Tribunal</a>. The Tribunals, however, were not authorized to determine whether the captives were <i><a href="../../../l/a/w/Lawful_combatant.html" title="Lawful combatant">lawful combatants</a></i> -- rather they were merely empowered to make a recommendation as to whether the captive had previously been correctly determined to match the Bush administration's definition of an <a href="../../../e/n/e/Enemy_combatant.html" title="Enemy combatant">enemy combatant</a>.</p>
<p>To comply with a <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedom_of_Information_Act_920f.html" title="Freedom of Information Act">Freedom of Information Act</a> request, during the winter and spring of 2005, the Department of Defense released 507 memoranda. Those 507 memoranda each contained the allegations against a single detainee, prepared for their Combatant Status Review Tribunals. The detainee's name and ID numbers were redacted from all but one of the memoranda. However 169 of the memoranda had the detainee's ID hand-written on the top right hand of the first page corner. When the Department of Defense complied with a <a href="../../../c/o/u/Court_order.html" title="Court order">court order</a>, and released official lists of the detainee's names and ID numbers it was possible to identify who those 169 were written about. Abdul Wahab was one of those 169 detainees.<sup id="_ref-SummaryOfEvidence273_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SummaryOfEvidence273" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>Wahab chose to participate in his Combatant Status Review Tribunal.<sup id="_ref-CsrtWahab_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CsrtWahab" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Wahab says he had boarded the minivan that picks up and drops off passengers along the road that passes through the village of <a href="../../../l/e/j/Lejay%2C_Afghanistan_9415.html" title="Lejay, Afghanistan">Lejay, Afghanistan</a> one hour before it was stopped at the checkpoint. He said that five of the other seven passengers had got on the bus before he did. He knew one other passenger, an old man named Jumandar.</p>
<p>He didn’t hear any firing, prior to his arrest. He said he was just a farmer, and that he had never fired a weapon in his entire life.</p>
<p>He denied there had ever been anything wrong with his hearing.</p>
<p>Wahab asked the Tribunal members to consider whether it would make sense for a someone who had launched a surprise attack to head back to their enemy, unarmed.</p>

<p>Detainees who were determined to have been properly classified as "enemy combatants" were scheduled to have their dossier reviewed at annual <a href="../../../a/d/m/Administrative_Review_Board_9651.html" title="Administrative Review Board">Administrative Review Board</a> hearings. The Administrative Review Boards weren't authorized to review whether a detainee qualified for POW status, and they weren't authorized to review whether a detainee should have been classified as an "enemy combatant".</p>
<p>They were authorized to consider whether a detainee should continue to be detained by the United States, because they continued to pose a threat -- or whether they could safely be repatriated to the custody of their home country, or whether they could be set free.</p>
