<p>Initially the Bush administration asserted that they could withhold all the protections of the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Geneva_Conventions_eb47.html" title="Geneva Conventions">Geneva Conventions</a> to captives from <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_war_on_terror.html" title="The war on terror">the war on terror</a>. This policy was challenged before the Judicial branch. Critics argued that the USA could not evade its obligation to conduct a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Competent_tribunal.html" title="Competent tribunal">competent tribunals</a> to determine whether captives are, or are not, entitled to the protections of <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prisoner_of_war.html" title="Prisoner of war">prisoner of war</a> status.</p>
<p>Subsequently the <a href="../../../d/e/p/Department_of_Defense_0d6c.html" title="Department of Defense">Department of Defense</a> instituted the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Combatant_Status_Review_Tribunal_41dd.html" title="Combatant Status Review Tribunal">Combatant Status Review Tribunals</a>. The Tribunals, however, were not authorized to determine whether the captives were <i>lawful combatants</i> -- rather they were merely empowered to make a recommendation as to whether the captive had previously been correctly determined to match the Bush administration's definition of an <a href="../../../e/n/e/Enemy_combatant.html" title="Enemy combatant">enemy combatant</a>.</p>
<p>Khan chose to participate in his Combatant Status Review Tribunal. For unexplained reasons the Guantanamo intelligence analysts who managed his case file separated the five pages that recorded the allegations and Khan's response to them from the rest of his testimony. <sup id="_ref-CsrtAbdullahKhan1_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CsrtAbdullahKhan1" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-CsrtAbdullahKhan2_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CsrtAbdullahKhan2" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p>In response to the allegatios:<sup id="_ref-CsrtAbdullahKhan1_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CsrtAbdullahKhan1" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<ul>
<li>Khan denied being a member of the Taliban, or having any sympathy for their ideas.</li>
<li>Khan acknowledged serving as a cook for the Taliban. He offered the following account of how he came to be a cook:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><i>I came from the province of <a href="../../../o/r/u/Oruzgan.html" title="Oruzgan">Oruzgan</a>, <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kandahar.html" title="Kandahar">Kandahar</a> [</i><a href="../../../s/i/c/Sic.html" title="Sic">sic</a><i>] for labor type work. There were fifty people harvesting the grapes. They came and surrounded us and the handcuffed us, like the draft, and took us with them. I had no choice and I had no power because that was their government. Just like how the Americans brought me, it was exactly the same thing they did to me. When they took us to their center, they asked me to take a weapon and fight for them. I told them I was scared, I cannot fight and I don't have the ability to fight. They said that I had to do something for them. They would not leave me alone like that. I said okay I could be a cook for them. I was very scared and I thought that if I didn't accept the job they would kill me.</i></dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Khan acknowledged fighting the Soviet invaders. He couldn't remember whether he fought the Soviets for two years or two months. Khan acknowledged that he had been responsible for distributing bullets to other anti-Soviet fighters.</li>
</ul>
<p>Khan said the anti-Soviet commander he fought under was Neymatullah.</p>
<ul>
<li>Khan offered a long account of his capture and hand-over to American forces. Khan had worked in the area where he was captured prior to the Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan. A year after the Karzai administration took over the administration of Afghanistan Khan returned to that area, for the first time since the Taliban took power, to sell produce at a large open-air market. At the market he met <a href="../../../h/a/j/Haji.html" title="Haji">Haji</a> <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shahzada.html" title="Shahzada">Shahzada</a>, a well off landowner he had worked for in his youth, who invited him to spend the night at his house. Khan also described meeting two men he described as the murderers of two of his family members, who he felt were trying to intimidate him. Khan believed that these men played a role in the false denunciations that lead to his capture.</li>
<li>Khan denied having any information regarding attacks on the United States.</li>
<li>Khan responded to the allegation that he was suspected of moving weapons:
<dl>
<dd><i>When and where? Once they told me it was the time of the Russians. I don't know when and where. Where did this come from.</i></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Khan denied discussing plans to attack the United States. He had spent the evening prior to his capture having dinner and playing cards with his host Shahzada and some friends of his.</li>

<li>Khan explained that he was not <a href="../../../k/h/i/Khirullah_Khairkhwa_953c.html" title="Khirullah Khairkhwa">Khirullah Khairkhwa</a>, the Governor of <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herat.html" title="Herat">Herat</a>. The bounty hunters who sold him to the US said he was Khairkhwa, in order to get a higher price for him.</li>
<li>Khan explained that he was a shop-keeper.

More recently he had sold Shahzada a dog.</li>
<li>Khan was arrested while staying at Shahzada'a house in Kandahar, while on a trip ot buy supplies for his shop. He said that this kind of hospitality, among acquaintances, who were from the same area, was not unusual in Afghan culture.</li>
<li>One of the allegations against Khan was that he was an airfield commander and pilot. Khan replied that he was illiterate, and didn't even know what a pilot was.</li>
<li>Shahzada submitted a written statement, which Khan's Personal Representative said confirmed Khan's account. When the Department of Defense partially complied with Judge <a href="../../../j/e/d/Jed_Rakoff_e510.html" title="Jed Rakoff">Jed Rakoff</a>'s court order they did not include Shahzada's statement. His Personal Representative said he filed a polygraph]] report that he said confirmed Khan's account.</li>

<p>They were authorized to consider whether a detainee should continue to be detained by the United States, because they continued to pose a threat -- or whether they could safely be repatriated to the custody of their home country, or whether they could be set free.</p>
