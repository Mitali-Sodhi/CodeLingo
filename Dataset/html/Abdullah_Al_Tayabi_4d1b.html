<p>Initially the Bush administration asserted that they could withhold all the protections of the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Geneva_Conventions_eb47.html" title="Geneva Conventions">Geneva Conventions</a> to captives from <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_war_on_terror.html" title="The war on terror">the war on terror</a>. This policy was challenged before the Judicial branch. Critics argued that the USA could not evade its obligation to conduct a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Competent_tribunal.html" title="Competent tribunal">competent tribunals</a> to determine whether captives are, or are not, entitled to the protections of <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prisoner_of_war.html" title="Prisoner of war">prisoner of war</a> status.</p>
<p>Subsequently the <a href="../../../d/e/p/Department_of_Defense_0d6c.html" title="Department of Defense">Department of Defense</a> instituted the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Combatant_Status_Review_Tribunal_41dd.html" title="Combatant Status Review Tribunal">Combatant Status Review Tribunals</a>. The Tribunals, however, were not authorized to determine whether the captives were <i>lawful combatants</i> -- rather they were merely empowered to make a recommendation as to whether the captive had previously been correctly determined to match the Bush administration's definition of an <a href="../../../e/n/e/Enemy_combatant.html" title="Enemy combatant">enemy combatant</a>.</p>

<p>Al Tayabi told his Tribunal that, while he was in <a href="../../../b/a/g/Bagram.html" title="Bagram">Bagram</a>, he was made to stand for seven to nine days, with his hands and feet bound, with guards depriving him of sleep.</p>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>In addition Al Tayabi told his Tribunal a detailed account of brutal torture while in Afghan custody, where he was warned that if he didn't repeat the story his Afghan torturers taught him, and the American returned him, they would kill him.</p>
<p>Al Tayabi said he found the threats credible because he saw his Afghan captors shoot and kill another prisoner.</p>
<p>Al Tayabi said that when he was transferred to American custody, in Bagram, they were brutal too. They beat him. One of his interrogators shoved a gun in his face and threatened to shoot him. Al Tayabi told his Tribunal he told the Red Cross about the abuse when the visited him in Afghanistan. He offered to show his Tribunal the scars this treatment left on him.</p>
<p>Al Tayabi said that in Kandahar he was stripped naked and left in the rain, with his hands and feet so tightly bound he couldn't move his feet for two weeks afterwards.</p>
<p>Al Tayabi told his Tribunal that his guards beat him every time the took him to the interrogators when he arrived in Cuba.</p>
<p>Al Tayabi said a Saudi delegation visited Guantanamo about a month after he arrived. He told them about the abuse, and felt he could ask his interrogators if he could see a psychologist. They refused even though he told them he had tried to commit suicide twice.</p>
<p>So he continued to repeat the story he had been taught by his Afghani captors.</p>
<p>His medication was arbitrarily withheld. His mail was withheld, or so heavily censored as to be unreadable. American interrogators kept trying to push him into additional confessions, and he felt convinced they had no interest in hearing the real truth.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/d/Abdullah_Al_Tayabi_4d1b.html" title="Edit section: Al Tayabi's response to the allegations against him">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Al Tayabi's response to the allegations against him</span></h3>
<p>Al Tayabi denied engaging in any hostilities, or carrying any weapons, or going anywhere near where there was any fighting.</p>
<p>Al Tayabi acknowledged traveling to Pakistan in August 2001. He acknowledged traveling to Afghanistan. Al tayabi's explanation for this travel was that he was a mechanical engineering student who was a big fan of hollywood movies. He had always wanted to learn how to fire a gun. But, in Saudi Arabia, an ordinary citizen had no opportunity to learn how to shoot, unless they joined the military, or the police -- options that were closed to him because he was underweight. He and a school-chum figured they could make a quick trip to Afghanistan, during their school break, long enough to try firing a gun.</p>
<p>Al Tayabi denied attending the Al Farouq training camp. This was part of the false story his Afghan captors had terrorized him into repeating. But it wasn't true. He was only in Afghanistan for about two weeks before the attacks of <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_11%2C_2001.html" title="September 11, 2001">September 11, 2001</a>.</p>
<p>Al Tayabi acknowledged that he watched a fellow guest, at the first house where he stayed in Afghanistan, named Abu Musif Al Miki, disassemble and clean his AK-47. Al Tayabi said they left their passports and most of their money at this first house, for safe-keeping, because they were warned they might be robbed.</p>
<p>Al Tayabi said that a friend of his school-chum took them to a second house, in Jalalabad, where they learned how to shoot a pistol. Al Tayabi said that they could have gone from this house, to a training camp, if they had been referred by someone those running the camp trusted. But, since they weren't, they weren't allowed to attend.</p>
<p>Al Tayabi said that after he had learned how to shoot a pistol, and learned he couldn't attend a training camp, he wanted to return home. But, before he could retrieve his passport Jalalabad became unsafe for foreigners. He was told all the passports were burned in the attacks. He and his two friends fled to the mountains. He lost his two friends, and joined with some other refugees. When they got to the village of Samer Kheer Afghanis kidnapped him, and demanded a ransom in order to be released. The other captives were able to have others buy their freedom, but he couldn't contact anyone, so they kept him in captivity.</p>
<p>These captors were the ones who trained him to give the false confessions.</p>
<p>Al Tayabi concluded by saying:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"I just want to go back and finish my school. I have no hatred against anybody or any country or toward America. Just the opposite, the Americans helped us against Sadam Hussein when he attacked my country."</i></dd>
