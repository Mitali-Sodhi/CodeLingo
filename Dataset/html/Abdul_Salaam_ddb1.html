<p>Initially the Bush administration asserted that they could withhold all the protections of the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Geneva_Conventions_eb47.html" title="Geneva Conventions">Geneva Conventions</a> to captives from <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_war_on_terror.html" title="The war on terror">the war on terror</a>. This policy was challenged before the Judicial branch. Critics argued that the USA could not evade its obligation to conduct a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Competent_tribunal.html" title="Competent tribunal">competent tribunals</a> to determine whether captives are, or are not, entitled to the protections of <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prisoner_of_war.html" title="Prisoner of war">prisoner of war</a> status.</p>
<p>Subsequently the <a href="../../../d/e/p/Department_of_Defense_0d6c.html" title="Department of Defense">Department of Defense</a> instituted the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Combatant_Status_Review_Tribunal_41dd.html" title="Combatant Status Review Tribunal">Combatant Status Review Tribunals</a>. The Tribunals, however, were not authorized to determine whether the captives were <i>lawful combatants</i> -- rather they were merely empowered to make a recommendation as to whether the captive had previously been correctly determined to match the Bush administration's definition of an <a href="../../../e/n/e/Enemy_combatant.html" title="Enemy combatant">enemy combatant</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/d/Abdul_Salaam_ddb1.html" title="Edit section: testimony">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">testimony</span></h3>
<p>Salaam acknowledged traveling to Pakistan to buy a rifle for personal protection. He said his area of the Afghanistan was loosely governed and locals were permitted by the Afghan government and the American forces to carry arms. Every head of household was allowed to own a rifle.</p>
<p>Salaam acknowledged that he didn't use a passport when crossing the Afghanistan/Pakistan border. Salaam said that locals who lived near the border never used a passport. He said that Pakistan government didn't ask Afghanis to use a passport.</p>
<p>Salaam acknowledged transferring money -- operating a <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawala.html" title="Hawala">Hawala</a>. He said money transfers was his business, and he was merely one of many money transfer agents. He stated that there was nothing illegal about this kind of business. He stated most of his clients were Afghanis, working overseas, who wanted to send funds to the families they had left behind.</p>
<p>Salaam denied being aware of any of his clients having ties to al Qaeda. He described the records he kept, and how all the receipients of the money transfers he handled were local people.</p>
<p>Salaam asked the names of the two customers suspected of links to al Qaida. The Tribunal President said they couldn't identify the two customers. Salaam speculated on the identities of these two suspects. He named two individuals who ran smaller Hawalas in neighbouring villages, who, in turn used his Hawala, Gulzar and Jacho.</p>
<p>Salaam denied being captured with someone who is the brother of an al Qaida leader, because he was alone, in his shop, when he was captured.</p>
<p>Salaam denied that his brother was a suspected senior Taliban financial facilitator. His brother was his partner.</p>
<p>Salaam denied being arrested with Taliban documents and contracts. He assured his Tribunal that he had never signed any documents with the Taliban. He said he was not captured with any documents whatsoever.</p>
<p>Salaam acknowledged knowing a local man named Mohammed. He knew Mohammed because he ran a local telephone office. He said that prior to his meeting Mohammed, through his local telephone office, he believed Mohammed had been a weapons dealer. He pointed out to his Tribunal that if he knew a local weapons dealer he would not have had to travel to Pakistan to buy his rifle.</p>
<p>Salaam acknowledged that his brother and his cousin were arrested the same day as he was, during a general sweep. His cousin worked as a security guard hired by the local businessmen at the local bazaar. His brother was captured in his house. He repeated that neither of them had ever transferred any money for, or had any relation to Taliban or Al Qaeda. His cousin and brother had been sent home, but he remained in detention.</p>
<p>In answering questions from the Tribunal's officers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Salaam said that, to the best of his knowledge, Faiz Mohammed stopped selling weapons ten or twelve</li>
</ul>
<p>years prior to his capture.</p>
<ul>
<li>Salaam said he hadn't heard from his brother since he was returned to Afghanistan.</li>
<li>Salaam said he was captured by a mixed force of both American and Afghani forces.</li>
<li>Salaam said he had no idea why he was captured. He said everyone knew the sweep of the bazaar was going on, and that if had anything to hide he would have run away.</li>
<li>Salaam was asked if he thought Gulzar was tied to the Taliban or al Qaeda. He said he did not believe that Gulzar had any ties to terrorism. Like him, he had operated his Hawala openly prior to his captuee, and he was still operating openly. He suggested after he had named Gulzar as an associate during his interrogation that if the authorities had reason to suspect Gulzar they surely would have captured him too.</li>
<li>Gulzar operates a Hawala, and he runs a local telephone office in his area.</li>
<li>Salaam said he had only completed the 4th or 5 grade of primary school, in Bernal Pakistan, while living with his uncle. He then went to work in his uncle's Hawala in Bernal.</li>
<li>Salaam said he was about 30 or 31 years old.</li>
<li>Salaam said he had never had any military training.</li>
<li>In addition to the AK-47 he had for personal protection he owned a shotgun, a pistol and a BB gun. His children use the BB gun for hunting.</li>
<li>Salaam was asked if he had to pay any taxes of business liscence during the Taliban's reign. He said he did not because the Taliban did not have any presence in his area.</li>
<li>Salaam said the nearest city was <a href="../../../w/a/n/Wanna.html" title="Wanna">Wanna</a>, Pakistan.</li>
<li>Salaam said his store was equipped with a phone, but no fax or computer.</li>
<li>Salaam said that in addition to his brother and cousin the authorities captured another man who had run another local telephone office in the bazaar. He too was sent to Cuba. He too had been returned to Afghanistan.</li>
<li>Salaam was asked if he was his brother's boss, or vice versa. He replied that he was the youngest of four brothers, who all jointly owned and operated their family's Hawala. His other two brother's had been working in their <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Arab_Emirates_edab.html" title="United Arab Emirates">United Arab Emirates</a>'s office, at the time of his capture. He and his brothers took turns staffing the UAE office.</li>
<li>Salaam said they didn't need to get a liscense from the Taliban, because they didn't operate in that area. He didn't know if the new government had issued liscencing regulations. He wasn't aware of any liscensing requirements before his capture.</li>
<li>Salaam was asked if he thought it was possible that some of his clients could have been Taliban or Al Qaeda members without his knowledge. He repeated that his clients were all local people, well known in the area. So he didn't believe it was possible that any of them could have been Taliban or al Qaeda. Plus, the amounts being transferred were only a few thousand Afghans at a time (something like $100 USD).</li>

<p>Detainees who were determined to have been properly classified as "enemy combatants" were scheduled to have their dossier reviewed at annual <a href="../../../a/d/m/Administrative_Review_Board_9651.html" title="Administrative Review Board">Administrative Review Board</a> hearings. The Administrative Review Boards weren't authorized to review whether a detainee qualified for POW status, and they weren't authorized to review whether a detainee should have been classified as an "enemy combatant".</p>
<p>They were authorized to consider whether a detainee should continue to be detained by the United States, because they continued to pose a threat -- or whether they could safely be repatriated to the custody of their home country, or whether they could be set free.</p>
