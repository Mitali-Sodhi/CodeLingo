<p>Initially the Bush administration asserted that they could withhold all the protections of the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Geneva_Conventions_eb47.html" title="Geneva Conventions">Geneva Conventions</a> to captives from <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_war_on_terror.html" title="The war on terror">the war on terror</a>. This policy was challenged before the Judicial branch. Critics argued that the USA could not evade its obligation to conduct a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Competent_tribunal.html" title="Competent tribunal">competent tribunals</a> to determine whether captives are, or are not, entitled to the protections of <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prisoner_of_war.html" title="Prisoner of war">prisoner of war</a> status.</p>
<p>Subsequently the <a href="../../../d/e/p/Department_of_Defense_0d6c.html" title="Department of Defense">Department of Defense</a> instituted the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Combatant_Status_Review_Tribunal_41dd.html" title="Combatant Status Review Tribunal">Combatant Status Review Tribunals</a>. The Tribunals, however, were not authorized to determine whether the captives were <i>lawful combatants</i> -- rather they were merely empowered to make a recommendation as to whether the captive had previously been correctly determined to match the Bush administration's definition of an <a href="../../../e/n/e/Enemy_combatant.html" title="Enemy combatant">enemy combatant</a>.</p>
<p>Rasoul chose to participate in his Combatant Status Review Tribunal.<sup id="_ref-CsrtRasoul_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CsrtRasoul" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Unlike other detainee's transcripts Rasoul's does not contain a point by point response to the allegations Rasoul faced in his CSRT's "summary of evidence". The transcript is only two pages long.</p>

<p>Rasoul had traveled to <a href="../../../k/a/b/Kabul.html" title="Kabul">Kabul</a> just because he wanted to see the big city, and was caught there during the US bombardment, where he was injured. After his wounds were treated at a <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">Chinese</a> hospital in <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kandahar.html" title="Kandahar">Kandahar</a>, he returned to <a href="../../../k/o/n/Konduz.html" title="Konduz">Konduz</a>, the nearest city to the village where he lived.</p>
<p>When he heard that the Americans were approaching Konduz he sought them out to surrender himself. He praised the American efforts to rebuild Afghanistan’s irrigation infrastructure. He told the Tribunal how his elders had praised the Americans for their help during the Soviet occupation. He said he had been showing pictures, in Guantanamo, showing the progress of the reconstruction, and that this made him happy with the American intervention.</p>

<p>Detainees who were determined to have been properly classified as "enemy combatants" were scheduled to have their dossier reviewed at annual <a href="../../../a/d/m/Administrative_Review_Board_9651.html" title="Administrative Review Board">Administrative Review Board</a> hearings. The Administrative Review Boards weren't authorized to review whether a detainee qualified for POW status, and they weren't authorized to review whether a detainee should have been classified as an "enemy combatant".</p>
<p>They were authorized to consider whether a detainee should continue to be detained by the United States, because they continued to pose a threat -- or whether they could safely be repatriated to the custody of their home country, or whether they could be set free.</p>

<li>Rasoul had said that the assertion that he traveled to Kabul to join the Taliban in 1997 was false.</li>

<li>Rasoul had told him he was unaware of any call to fight Jihad in 1997.</li>
<li>Rasoul had denied asserting that it would be correct to wage Jihad against Americans or Israelis. He had reiterated that he had welcomed and appreciated the American intervention and reconstruction efforts.</li>

<ul>
<li>Rasoul repeated that he didn’t have any objection to America.</li>
<li>Rasoul repeated that he appreciated the American’s efforts to rebuild his country.</li>
<li>Rasoul repeated that he traveled to Kabul just to see the sights.</li>
<li>Rasoul attributed the capture of innocent men, like himself, to the bounties US intelligence paid for the capture of Taliban or Al Qaeda fighters.</li>
<li>Rasoul pointed out that there had been animosity between the Uzbek portion of Afghanistan, where the Northern Alliance was based, and the Pashtun portion of Afghanistan where he lived, and where the Taliban was based, for over four hundred years.</li>
</ul>
<p>In answering questions Rasoul stated:</p>
<ul>
<li>The local Taliban commander had told the population to surrender. Almost everyone complied, both civilian and Taliban fighters and officials.</li>
<li>In 1997 he was very young, and still in school.</li>
<li>His September 2001 visit to Kabul was his first trip to Kabul.</li>
<li>He said that there was nothing remarkable about being issued a rifle by the Taliban. At that time they insisted that every man walk about armed.</li>
<li>In answer to a question as to why he was wearing the orange jumpsuit, not the white jumpsuit that compliant detainees wore, Rasoul said he had an argument with a guard over the policy of only allowing detainees to shower once every three days, and because the guard had shown disrespect to his Koran.</li>
