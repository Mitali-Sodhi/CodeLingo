<p>He was born to <a href="../../../n/o/s/Nosrat_Dowleh_Firouz_Mirza_5203.html" title="Nosrat Dowleh Firouz Mirza">Prince Nosrat Dowleh Firouz Mirza</a> in approximately 1859 through his wife Hajieh Homa Khanoum. His youth was spent perfecting the arts of swordmanship, poetry, hunting, riding, calligraphy, ceremonial etiquette, and other subjects required of a Persian nobleman. He continued his education at the Austrian Military Academy in Tehran where he distinguished himself as a soldier and strategist. He also showed himself to be an enthusiastic builder of bridges and roads, with a very keen interest in new Western sciences and social improvements. By 1882, following his time in the academy, he reached the rank of colonel and took of the military units in the province of Kerman. Two years later in 1884, he was re-assigned to <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iranian_Azarbaijan_fc5a.html" title="Iranian Azarbaijan">Iranian Azarbaijan</a> where he became the Commander of the Qarasuran Corps (Gendarmerie and Security Administration). In 1886, Abdol Hossein Mirza's father passed away. In recognition of his distinguished military service, he is awarded the title of "Amir Tooman" in 1887. Shortly afterwards he married Princess Ezzat-Dowleh, daughter of the king and his first of four wives, in 1888. At the time he was approximately thirty years old. Following the marriage, and out of respect for Ezzat-Dowleh and also due to her high social rank, he took no other wives for the next twenty years. During part of this time he served as Commander in Chief of the Army in Azarbaijan, Govenor of Kerman (twice), Govenor of Kurdistan, Govenor of Fars, Govenor of Kermanshah, and Govenor of Azarbaijan. In his capacity as govenor he founded one of Iran's first secular schools for girls.</p>

<p>In 1899, due to the intrigues of the <a href="../../../m/o/z/Mozzafar-al-Din_Shah_ffce.html" title="Mozzafar-al-Din Shah">Mozzafar-al-Din Shah</a>'s entourage he was exiled to <a href="../../../b/a/g/Baghdad.html" title="Baghdad">Baghdad</a> in <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottoman_Empire_4168.html" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman</a> Mesopotamia. His wife Princess Ezzat-Dowleh (Mozafar din Shah's daughter), voluntarily fled with him into exile and stayed with him for five years. She was then able to convince the Shah to let Abdol Hossein Mirza Farmanfarma return. Upon his return Abol Hossein sent his sons to schools in Europe, leaving his wife very much alone. The two grew further apart as time passed.</p>
<p>In 1906 the ascendance of her brother <a href="../../../m/o/h/Mohammad_Ali_Shah_7d51.html" title="Mohammad Ali Shah">Mohammad Ali Shah</a> to the throne plunged the country into civil war again as the new shah tried to crush the democratic movement. During the Iranian Civil War Farmanfarma sided with the constitutionalists who were victorious. He continued his government service by holding the posts of Minister of Justice and War Minister. He also became the leader of a party of conservative moderates. In his role as Minister for Justice he introduced the Western custom of court trials into the Persian legal system.</p>
<p>Eventually, Farmanfarma was dispatched by the Shah to <a href="../../../t/a/b/Tabriz.html" title="Tabriz">Tabriz</a> in order to make peace between warring Persian and <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurdish_people.html" title="Kurdish people">Kurdish</a> tribes. During his stay there he had married his second wife, the daughter of a Kurdish mountain chief, in order to seal a pact. The young Kurdish bride had actually been sent back to her tribe and died a few years later. Princess Ezzat-Dowleh and Abdol Hossein Mirza Farmanfarma grew even more apart and the two became completely estranged.</p>
<p>In 1911 Farmanfarma married his second true wife, Masoumeh Khanoum who was accepted by a very lonely Princess Ezzat-Dowleh amidst the chaos of the civil war. Abdol Hossein Mirza Farmanfarma returned to <a href="../../../t/e/h/Tehran.html" title="Tehran">Tehran</a> in 1915 after quelling the secession in the west of <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran.html" title="Iran">Iran</a>. With his arrival he brought his third wife, named Batul (the marriage, like that of his Kurdish wife, was to seal a pact).</p>
<p>Farmanfarma was in Tehran for only one year, serving first as War Minister and then as Prime Minister. For most of his tenure he was trying to keep the country unified, which he successfully managed to do. During his time as Prime Minister, he established the Ministry of Health, and created the Pasteur Institute of Iran whose first action was to introduce a smallpox vaccine that saved countless lives. After only three months he resigned from the post of Prime Minister. In 1916, he returned to <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shiraz.html" title="Shiraz">Shiraz</a> for his second appointment as govenor general of the <a href="../../../f/a/r/Fars.html" title="Fars">Fars</a> province.</p>
<p>On his arrival in Shiraz, the entire province was in total chaos. His first task was to prevent the spread of a famine. He carried this out by organising Iran's first agricultural cooperative. To ensure his acceptance by the people of Shiraz he took a wife, Fatimeh Khanoum, from one of the leading local families. He also raised an all-Iranian regiment to restore security and order to the province with the help of <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Britain_b139.html" title="Great Britain">British</a> General Sykes who referred to Farmanfarma as "my friend" in his famous <i>History of Persia</i>. Sykes also went on to praise Farmanfarma as "one of the ablest men in Iran". Farmanfarma for his part was a well known Anglophile.</p>
<p>He completed his term as the govenor of <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shiraz.html" title="Shiraz">Shiraz</a> in 1921 when he was replaced by his nephew <a href="../../../m/o/h/Mohammad_Mossadegh_d3f1.html" title="Mohammad Mossadegh">Dr. Mohammad Mossadegh</a>. Upon his return to <a href="../../../t/e/h/Tehran.html" title="Tehran">Tehran</a> he was arrested, with two of his elder sons (<a href="../../../f/i/r/Firouz_Mirza_Nosrat-ed-Dowleh_Farman_Farmaian_III_2b3d.html" title="Firouz Mirza Nosrat-ed-Dowleh Farman Farmaian III">Nosrat Dowleh</a> the foreign minister, <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_Abbas_Mirza_Farman_Farmaian_d5f0.html" title="Prince Abbas Mirza Farman Farmaian">Abbas Mirza Salar-Lashgar</a> a general), by <a href="../../../r/e/z/Reza_Shah_38d5.html" title="Reza Shah">Reza Shah</a> who had just taken power in a coup. He spent the next three months in the Qasr-e-Qajar jail until Reza Shah had proclaimed himself War Minister and consolidated his power base. Upon his release Abdol Hossein Mirza Farmanfarma retired from politics and tended to his remaining estates and villages from <a href="../../../t/e/h/Tehran.html" title="Tehran">Tehran</a> after a great portion of them were confiscated by <a href="../../../r/e/z/Reza_Shah_38d5.html" title="Reza Shah">Reza Shah</a>. He spent his final years under house arrest suffering from gout, arthritus, and insomnia. He died in 1939 and is burried in the Shrine of Shazdeh Abdol Azim.</p>

<p>The founder of the <a href="../../../p/a/h/Pahlavi.html" title="Pahlavi">Pahlavi</a> dynasty, <a href="../../../r/e/z/Reza_Shah_38d5.html" title="Reza Shah">Reza Shah</a>, then known as Reza Khan or "Master Reza" was a sergent in the household guard known for his bravery and strength. When Farmanfarma equipped his unit with <a href="../../../m/a/x/Maxim_gun.html" title="Maxim gun">Maxim Machine Guns</a> he promoted <a href="../../../r/e/z/Reza_Shah_38d5.html" title="Reza Shah">Reza Khan</a> to the rank of officer and gave him command of a gun. After that, <a href="../../../r/e/z/Reza_Shah_38d5.html" title="Reza Shah">Reza Khan</a> was to be known as "Reza Khan-i-Maximi": Machine-Gun Reza. Over the next 14 years Reza Khan progressed to the rank of Field Commander under the command of Farmanfarma before becoming involved in a British backed coup to establish himself as the new Shah. After the coup in 1921, Farmanfarma demanded to see <a href="../../../r/e/z/Reza_Shah_38d5.html" title="Reza Shah">Reza Khan</a> when he heard that two of his sons had been arrested. When he walked into <a href="../../../r/e/z/Reza_Shah_38d5.html" title="Reza Shah">Reza Khan</a> room, Reza Khan (the Minister of War) jumped to attention in respect for his old commander. It was Reza Khan's Prime Minister, Seyeed Zia who managed to get Farmanfarma arrested and put into jail for three months while Reza Khan consolidated his power base. Farmanfarma was released the minute Syeed Zia was taken to jail himself.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/d/Abdol_Hossein_Mirza_Farmanfarma_f2e0.html" title="Edit section: Name and Title">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Name and Title</span></h2>
<p>His full official name and title was <b>Hazrat Aghdas Vala Shahzadeh Abdol Hossein Mirza Farman-Farma</b>. This translates directly as "His Highness, Prince Abol Hossein, the Eminent and Exalted One, the Greatest of All Commanders." When surnames became compulsory he took his last title as his family name., viz. Farman-Farma literally translating to "Greatest of All Commanders".</p>
<p>The title "Farman Farma" did not originate with Prince Abdol-Hossein Mirza Farman Farma. It was first held by his grand-uncle Hossein Ali Mirza Farman Farma, Abbas Mirza Nayeb Saltaneh's younger half-brother. Prince Abdol Hossein Mirza's father, Prince Firouz Mirza would battle his own uncle, Prince Hossein Ali Mirza Farman Farma, in support his brother Prince Mohammad Mirza (later <a href="../../../m/o/h/Mohammad_Shah_Qajar_1f12.html" title="Mohammad Shah Qajar">Mohammad Shah Qajar</a>) and win the right to the succession for Prince Mohammad Mirza. Forty years later, <a href="../../../n/a/s/Nasser-al-Din_Shah_5cac.html" title="Nasser-al-Din Shah">Nasser-al-Din Shah</a>, Firouz Mirza's nephew, would bestow the title Farman Farma on Prince Firouz Mirza in gratitude for his role in consolidating the succession to the <a href="../../../q/a/j/Qajar.html" title="Qajar">Qajar</a> (Kadjar) Throne. The title Farman Farma then passed on to his son Prince Abdol Hossein Mirza, during the reign of Nasser-ed-Din Shah. Nasser-ed-din Shah and Prince Abdol Hossein Mirza were cousins, but Nasser-ed-Din Shah was about thirty years his senior. Only Prince Abdol Hossein Mirza carried the title "Farman-Farma", while his offspring carry the family name derived from the former title "Farman-Farmaian" <i>(lit. Those belonging to Farman-Farma)</i></p>

<p>Contrary to many Persian politicians and royal household members at the time and due to the uncertain political climate, Farmanfarma felt that his sons and daughters should obtain modern European educations as opposed to Classical Persian Educations. He ensured that they worked particularly hard towards this goal throughout their lives. As a consequence the vast majority of his sons and daughters, after having obtained first class educations, went on to work in senior and key roles throughout the Iranian government from the turn of the century through to the 1970s.</p>
