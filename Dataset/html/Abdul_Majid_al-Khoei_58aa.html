Sayyid Abdul Majid al-Khoei</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>He lived and studied under his father in Najaf until 1991. During the Shia uprising of <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a> he actively took part in the fighting against Saddam's <a href="../../../b/a/27/Ba%27ath_Party_2744.html" title="Ba'ath Party">Ba'ath Party</a> but also acted as a force of moderation attempting to minimize revenge killings. When the uprising was crushed he was forced to leave <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraq.html" title="Iraq">Iraq</a>. His father died a year later in 1992 at the age of 93, still under house arrest in Iraq.</p>
<p>In exile in <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> he worked for the al-Khoei Foundation a charitable foundation set up by his father in 1989, becoming its head in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a> when his brother, Sayyid Mohammed Taqqi al-Khoei, was assassinated whilst driving back to <a href="../../../n/a/j/Najaf.html" title="Najaf">Najaf</a> from a visit to <a href="../../../k/e/r/Kerbala.html" title="Kerbala">Kerbala</a>.</p>
<p>He was also an outspoken critic of <a href="../../../s/a/d/Saddam_Hussein_75a3.html" title="Saddam Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a>'s rule: "The regime's criminal acts, beginning in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1968.html" title="1968">1968</a>, have been never-ending. Executions, the closing of schools, mosques and shrines sacred to Shia worshipers; the burning of old religious scriptures; looting the sacred sites of gifts left by presidents and kings.". He did however, also call for unity. Speaking in December 2002 he said "We are looking for a new Iraq in which everyone has a share... we want to forget the past and shake the hand of everyone"</p>
<p>He returned to Iraq in April <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a> after the fall of Saddam despite being warned of the dangers. He arrived in Najaf on 3 April. Speaking to The Times upon his arrival to the city, he said everyone "wanted news on Baghdad because they see that as the key test to whether this will be 1991 all over again." Though assigned protection, the protective unit could not follow him into the shrine of <a href="../../../a/l/i/Ali_ibn_Abi_Talib_924a.html" title="Ali ibn Abi Talib">Imam Ali</a> in Najaf on 10 April 2003. Here he was attacked and hacked to death by a mob.</p>
<p><a href="../../../m/o/q/Moqtada_al-Sadr_6c54.html" title="Moqtada al-Sadr">Moqtada al-Sadr</a> was suspected by U.S. and Iraqi authorities of ordering the assassination. According to witnesses, at the mosque he was walking with Haidar Raifee Killidar, the custodian of the shrine under Saddam, and they were confronted by an angry mob, some of whom are reported to have shouted "Raifee is back" and others "Long live al-Sadr". The mob killed Raifee with bayonets and knives; al-Khoei, who was critically injured by this time, was taken to Moqtada, on whose order he was fatally stabbed to death.</p>
<p>Al-Sadr claims the murderers were not his followers and that he in fact sent men to save al-Khoei from the murderers, but he seemed unconcerned over the death; additionally witnesses say that members of the mob claimed to be there on al-Sadr's orders, and that he had instructed them not to kill al-Khoei inside the mosque. Al-Khoei's close followers did not blame al-Sadr for the murder<sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup>, but instead publicly blamed former Baath party members who also hated al-Khoei. On April 5, 2004, a warrant was issued for Sadr's arrest in connection with this killing. Arrest warrants were also issued for 12 men on charges of planning and carrying out the murder. The arrest warrants were issued by an Iraqi Judge, Raed Juhi, who is also the investigative judge in charge of the Saddam Hussain case.</p>
<p>Although a religious cleric himself, he was hated by some Iraqi religious scholars and leaders because of his close links with the American and British governments. <sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup> In a trip to <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran.html" title="Iran">Iran</a> in 2002, he was poorly received by the Iraqi community <sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup> who heckled "Go Back To America" as he was giving a speech in the city of <a href="../../../q/u/m/Qum.html" title="Qum">Qum</a>, some 150km south of <a href="../../../t/e/h/Tehran.html" title="Tehran">Tehran</a>. When he arived in Najaf a few days before his death, none of the four <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marja.html" title="Marja">Grand Ayatullahs</a> in the city accepted to receive him, not even <a href="../../../s/i/s/Sistani.html" title="Sistani">Grand Ayatullah Al-Sistani</a>. This was mainly because he arrived to the city on the back of US Tanks and was assigned a special forces protection unit.</p>
<p>He was seen as a moderate cleric by the west and as pro-US by many Iraqis. British Prime Minister <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Blair_f43c.html" title="Tony Blair">Tony Blair</a>, who met al-khoei for talks before his departure, said he was "a religious leader who embodied hope and reconciliation and who was committed to building a better future for the people of Iraq". His murder was also "strongly condemned" by US President Bush's administration.</p>
<p>He is burried alongside his brother and father inside the Imam Ali shrine in Najaf in a designated room for the al-Khoei family.</p>
<p>He leaves behind a wife and four children who live in London.</p>
