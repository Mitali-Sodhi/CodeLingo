	    <p><b>A.J. (Arthur J.) Raffles</b> is a character created in the 1890s by <a href="../../../e/r/n/Ernest_William_Hornung_d8f9.html" title="Ernest William Hornung">E. W. Hornung</a>, a brother-in-law to <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Conan_Doyle_84ae.html" title="Arthur Conan Doyle">Arthur Conan Doyle</a>, the creator of <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sherlock_Holmes_4282.html" title="Sherlock Holmes">Sherlock Holmes</a>. Raffles is, in many ways, a deliberate inversion of Holmes — he is a "<a href="../../../g/e/n/Gentleman_thief.html" title="Gentleman thief">gentleman thief</a>," living in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Albany_d308.html" title="The Albany">Albany</a>, a very upscale address in <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>, playing <a href="../../../c/r/i/Cricket.html" title="Cricket">cricket</a> for the Gentlemen of England and supporting himself by carrying out ingenious burglaries. He is called the "Amateur Cracksman," and often, at first, differentiates between himself and the "professors" — professional criminals from the lower classes.</p>
<p>As Holmes has <a href="../../../d/r/2E/Dr._Watson_b11f.html" title="Dr. Watson">Dr. Watson</a> to chronicle his adventures, Raffles has Harry "Bunny" Manders — a former schoolmate saved from disgrace and suicide by Raffles, who persuaded him to accompany him on a <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burglary.html" title="Burglary">burglary</a>. While Raffles often takes advantage of Manders' relative innocence, and sometimes treats him with a certain amount of contempt, he knows that Manders' bravery and loyalty are utterly to be relied on. In several stories, Manders saves the day for the two of them after Raffles gets into situations he cannot get out of on his own.</p>
<p>One of the things that Raffles has in common with Holmes is a mastery of <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disguise.html" title="Disguise">disguise</a> — during his days as an ostensible man-about-town, he maintains a studio <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartment.html" title="Apartment">apartment</a> in another name in which he keeps the components of various disguises, and he can imitate the regional speech of many parts of Britain flawlessly, despite his lack of skill at foreign languages.</p>

<p>The "Raffles" stories have two distinct phases. In the first phase, Raffles and Bunny are men-about-town who also commit burglaries. Raffles is a famous gentleman cricketer, a marvellous spin bowler who is often invited to social events that would be out of his reach otherwise. "I was asked about for my cricket," he comments after this period is over. It ends when they are caught and exposed on an ocean voyage while attempting another theft; Raffles dives overboard and is presumed drowned. These stories were collected in <i>The Amateur Cracksman</i>.</p>
<p>The second phase begins some time later when Bunny - having served a prison sentence - is summoned to the house of a rich invalid. This turns out to be Raffles himself, back in England in disguise. Then begins their "professional" period, exiled from Society, in which they are straightforward thieves trying to earn a living while keeping Raffles's identity a secret. They finally volunteer for the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Boer_War_db66.html" title="Second Boer War">Boer War</a>, where Bunny is wounded and Raffles dies in battle after exposing an enemy spy. These stories were originally collected in <i>The Black Mask</i>, although they were subsequently published in one volume with the phase one stories.</p>
<p>Like Sherlock Holmes after his disappearance into the <a href="../../../r/e/i/Reichenbach_Falls_a49e.html" title="Reichenbach Falls">Reichenbach Falls</a>, Raffles was never quite the same after his reappearance. The 'classic' Raffles elements are all found in the first stories: cricket, the Albany, high society, West End clubs, Bond Street jewellers... and two men in immaculate evening dress pulling-off impossible robberies.</p>
<p>The Raffles character was continued by <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barry_Perowne_35e6.html" title="Barry Perowne">Barry Perowne</a>, who wrote stories set in two different milieux: one set had Raffles as a fairly-typical <a href="../../../1/9/3/1930s.html" title="1930s">1930s</a>-era pulp adventure hero, and the other, in which Raffles only ever committed crimes for reasons of compassion, set in Raffles' original time, the last two decades of <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victoria_of_the_United_Kingdom_5e8e.html" title="Victoria of the United Kingdom">Queen Victoria's</a> life and reign.</p>
<p><a name="Personality" id="Personality"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/2E/_/A._J._Raffles_2741.html" title="Edit section: Personality">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Personality</span></h2>
<p>Raffles is cynical about society, but would settle down permanently if he could just make a big enough haul. At one point, he comments "we can't all be moralists, and the distribution of wealth is all wrong anyway," suggesting that he is less contented with the state of affairs in late-<a href="../../../v/i/c/Victorian_era.html" title="Victorian era">Victorian</a> <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a> than he seems to be. He is aware of the fact that many people who seem to be his friends only like him for his cricket, and he himself has lost all interest in the sport, keeping it up only for its excellent possibilities as a cover for his real occupation (which he considers far more interesting and exciting) and as mental practice. He does have scruples, despite his profession — he will not steal from his host, and he is reluctant to kill, although he does so once and plans to at another time. He also does feel badly about the way he abuses Manders' loyalty.</p>
<p>Despite the risks he already takes, he is sometimes still a sportsman, and some of his crimes are for motives other than pure profit. In a late story, he steals a gold cup from the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Museum_7dce.html" title="British Museum">British Museum</a> on impulse: when challenged by Bunny as to how he will dispose of it, he posts it to the Queen as a <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diamond_Jubilee_9806.html" title="Diamond Jubilee">Diamond Jubilee</a> present. In another, he steals money from a tight-fisted <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_boy_network.html" title="Old boy network">Old Boy</a> in order to make a donation to their former school in the name of "An Old Boy," shaming the man into making a donation after he had said he would not. His last crime, committed just before he goes off to the <a href="../../../b/o/e/Boer_War_c1b1.html" title="Boer War">Boer War</a>, is to steal a collection of memorabilia of his crimes from <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland_Yard_5bca.html" title="Scotland Yard">Scotland Yard</a>'s <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Museum_8076.html" title="Black Museum">Black Museum</a>.</p>
<p>The stories have a <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gay.html" title="Gay">gay</a> <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subtext.html" title="Subtext">subtext</a>. The relationship between Raffles and Bunny, who clearly adulates him (<i>His eyes were sparkling. His smile was firm.</i>), has a strong <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homoerotic.html" title="Homoerotic">homoerotic</a> undertone; see <a href="http://www.trashfiction.co.uk/raffles.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.trashfiction.co.uk/raffles.html">[1]</a>. Bunny was Raffles's <a href="../../../f/a/g/Fagging.html" title="Fagging">fag</a> at school, an old English system, now abolished, whereby younger boys did what was asked of them by older ones; sometimes this included sex. Neither shows any interest in women throughout the stories. They lead a secret double life of thrilling, mostly night-time, crime. There's a lot of tying up <a href="../../../b/o/n/Bondage.html" title="Bondage">bondage</a> and rescuing.</p>
<pre>
 *The above is quite inaccurate.  Raffles himself was involved with three women, two of which <br />
were quite serious.  In "The Gift of the Emperor" Raffles promenades a Miss Werner, whom he <br />
kisses before making his escape.  In "Fate of Faustina" Raffles tells the story of the loss of his<br />
 truest love, Faustina.  Finally, in "An Old Flame" he is confronted by a former lover, <br />
Jacques Saillard, the Spanish artist, whose obsession with Raffles causes him to fake his death <br />
by typhoid.  As for Harry "Bunny" Manders, the story "Out of Paradise" relates Bunny's disgrace <br />
in a burglary before his true love, whose name is never mentioned.  The comment that there is a <br />
lot of <a href="../../../b/o/n/Bondage.html" title="Bondage">bondage</a> is entirely out of context.  All these stories may be found in "The Collected <br />
Raffles Stories" with a forward by Clive Bloom.*
