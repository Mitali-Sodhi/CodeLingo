<p>Initially the Bush administration asserted that they could withhold all the protections of the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Geneva_Conventions_eb47.html" title="Geneva Conventions">Geneva Conventions</a> to captives from <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_war_on_terror.html" title="The war on terror">the war on terror</a>. This policy was challenged before the Judicial branch. Critics argued that the USA could not evade its obligation to conduct a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Competent_tribunal.html" title="Competent tribunal">competent tribunals</a> to determine whether captives are, or are not, entitled to the protections of <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prisoner_of_war.html" title="Prisoner of war">prisoner of war</a> status.</p>
<p>Subsequently the <a href="../../../d/e/p/Department_of_Defense_0d6c.html" title="Department of Defense">Department of Defense</a> instituted the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Combatant_Status_Review_Tribunal_41dd.html" title="Combatant Status Review Tribunal">Combatant Status Review Tribunals</a>. The Tribunals, however, were not authorized to determine whether the captives were <i>lawful combatants</i> -- rather they were merely empowered to make a recommendation as to whether the captive had previously been correctly determined to match the Bush administration's definition of an <a href="../../../e/n/e/Enemy_combatant.html" title="Enemy combatant">enemy combatant</a>.</p>

<p>Al Kandari acknowledged traveling to the area of the <a href="../../../p/a/k/Pakistan.html" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>-Afghanistan border. He said his purpose was humanitarian aid. He acknowledged taking $15,000. $13,000 of which he used to aid refugees, reserving $2,000 for his return to Kuwait. He had never traveled to Pakistan or Afghanistan before. And didn't know anyone associated with al Qaeda or the Taliban.</p>
<p>Amnesty International says he was captured during a sweep when Pakistani authorities arrested all foreigners.</p>

<p>Al Kandari seemed surprised that his possession of his watch was regarded as evidence that he was a security threat. He said that his model was very common and popular in Kuwait because it had a feature that helped the owner know what direction <a href="../../../m/e/c/Mecca.html" title="Mecca">Mecca</a> was, in order to perform their daily prayers.</p>
<p>The Tribunal asked Al Kandari if he had ever modified his watch. He said the only work that had ever been performed on it was a simple replacement of a worn out battery.</p>
<p>The Tribunal officers asked Al Kandari if his watch had a feature that helped him pray to Mecca. His watch did have that feature. The Tribunal documents refer to him owning a Casio F91W watch. The F91W does not have the Mecca prayer feature, and costs about a quarter as much as the models that do have this feature.</p>

<p>Al Kandari agreed to give a statement to the Tribunal. In it he said:</p>
<ul>
<li>His desire to go to the Pakistan-Afghanistan border was prompted by reports in the Islamic press that, following the American attack, millions of refugees were trying to leave. The reports said the refugees weren't being allowed the border, and were suffering in ad hoc refugee camps. Because the charities he usually donated to had no facilities to help the refugees he decided to go himself.</li>
<li>The first leg of his journey, the trip from Kuwait, to <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran.html" title="Iran">Iran</a>, to Takat Afghanistan was successful. He carried a letter, written in <a href="../../../p/a/s/Pashtu.html" title="Pashtu">Pashtu</a>, explaining his goal. He found a local man, who bought food and blankets for the refugees.</li>
<li>The return leg of his journey he described was a disaster. Even though his passport had a stamp showing he crossed from Iran to Afghanistan, they wouldn't allow him to cross back in. They were stopping all <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab.html" title="Arab">Arabs</a> at the border. (Iran and Afghanistan are not Arabic countries.)</li>
<li>After the fall of the Taliban things were very dangerous for foreigners in Afghanistan. Many ordinary Afghans had resented the ties the Taliban had with al Qaeda, and its foreign leadership. Foreigners risked robbery, kidnapping and murder.</li>
<li>Al Kandari managed to make it across the Pakistani border. But he didn't have legal travel documents for Pakistan.</li>
<li>Al Kandari was captured in Pakistan. He was told he would be provided consular access, but was handed over to American authorities instead.</li>

<p>Detainees who were determined to have been properly classified as "enemy combatants" were scheduled to have their dossier reviewed at annual <a href="../../../a/d/m/Administrative_Review_Board_9651.html" title="Administrative Review Board">Administrative Review Board</a> hearings. The Administrative Review Boards weren't authorized to review whether a detainee qualified for POW status, and they weren't authorized to review whether a detainee should have been classified as an "enemy combatant".</p>
<p>They were authorized to consider whether a detainee should continue to be detained by the United States, because they continued to pose a threat -- or whether they could safely be repatriated to the custody of their home country, or whether they could be set free.</p>
<p>The factors for and against continuing to hold Al Kandari were among the 121 that the Department of Defense released on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_3.html" title="March 3">March 3</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>.<sup id="_ref-FactorsAbdullahKamelAbdullahKamelAlKandari_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-FactorsAbdullahKamelAbdullahKamelAlKandari" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p>Al Kandari chose to participate in his Administrative Review Board hearing.<sup id="_ref-ArbKamel_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ArbKamel" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Included with the transcript from Al Kandari's testimony was 93 pages of submission from his <a href="../../../h/a/b/Habeas_corpus.html" title="Habeas corpus">habeas corpus</a> lawyers. Those documents include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A letter from his wife, describing the desperate need, she, their children, and the rest of his family felt for the return of her husband.</li>
<li>A letter from his elderly mother, describing her need for his return.</li>
<li>A letter from one of his children, wishing for his return.</li>
<li>A letter from his sister, Deena Kamel Abdullah, who described how helpful Abdullah was to her. She had been separated from her husband for seven years, and her brother Abdullah had supported her financially, until she could find work, he had helped her find work, and had helped and encouraged her to continue her education. He had served as a substitute father for her children, who miss him much more than they miss their real father. He had provided the same kind of kind, generous support to their parents, and to their other siblings.</li>

<dd>"<i>When they told me that Casios were used by Al Qaeda and the watch was for explosives, I was shocked…. If I had known that, I would have thrown it away. I’m not stupid. We have four chaplains [at Guantanamo]; all of them wear this watch.</i>"</dd>
